It’s easy to see upgrades as another big-ticket project that drains your budget. But that mindset misses the bigger picture. During our 15 years working in energy efficiency, we have found that the most cost-effective way to modernize HVAC systems is to address temperature controls. By using cutting-edge equipment to control the various mechanical systems, everything runs more efficiently, bringing our customers significant and sometimes unexpected gains. Modernizing your HVAC system isn’t just about ripping out the old and putting in the new. With some strategy, it’s one of the smartest investments you can make in your building. From slashing energy waste to improving comfort and extending equipment life, today’s systems deliver measurable returns. In fact, many of our customers see payback in as little as three to five years. It’s also important to remember that HVAC modernization isn’t one size fits all. While some scenarios might require a rip-and-replace of the whole system, we often find that modernizing just parts of it—like temperature controls, for example—can have a significant impact for a fraction of the cost. So, let’s break down the myth that HVAC modernization is just an expense and start seeing it as the solid investment that it really is. Here are five reasons why. Building operations use about 40% of the energy and 74% of the electricity produced in the U.S. annually. It’s safe to say that if you hate to see winter or summer coming because of the heating and cooling bills, you’re not alone. Older HVAC systems are inefficient , often running full tilt even when spaces are empty or are too sluggish to heat or cool specific areas of the building properly. Modern controls and equipment can change that. Upgrading gives you smarter tools to schedule and fine-tune temperatures so you’re not wasting energy. Using Department of Energy modeling tools, we can show and verify the savings clients can expect before we even start the modernization process. By mapping out the returns on investment at the beginning of the process, clients know what to expect. For example, we work with a client who operates a large church and conference center complex. After modernizing their temperature control system and implementing advanced scheduling software, they are on track to save a whopping 50% on energy expenses—equating to approximately $50,000 to $60,000 in annual savings. Imagine starting your day with dozens of calls from tenants complaining they’re too cold or too hot—every day. Aging HVAC systems are notorious for creating “hot and cold zones” that freeze out people in one office, while creating a sauna in another. It’s frustrating for building occupants and facility teams alike to constantly field complaints rather than focus on managing their buildings. Modern control systems deliver more consistent, balanced temperatures throughout the building. Smart sensors monitor conditions and automatically adjust, keeping the environment comfortable and predictable. Further, modern temperature control systems can integrate with the building’s architecture, accounting for factors such as eastern and western exposures and solar load. For example, one of our clients is a mechanical engineer at a large office building, whose 1960s architecture presents a significant challenge: four stories of beautiful, but energy-inefficient, huge glass panes. Offices facing east needed a bump in cooling in the morning, while those with a western exposure required extra cooling in the afternoon. While modernizing their temperature control system, our team created zones that allow the mechanical engineer to fine-tune temperatures in different areas. These customized zones and the ability to individually control temperatures helped keep all occupants comfortable throughout the day, and he even saw a 90% reduction in calls about rooms that were too hot or too cold! Comfort might sound like a soft benefit, but when you reduce those daily frustrations, you can boost productivity, morale, and trust in your facility team. If you’ve ever spent a morning chasing down alarms, running to remote buildings, or hunting for a single faulty valve, you know how much time an old system can steal. Modern HVAC systems can give that time back. Remote monitoring, fault detection, and data dashboards allow your team to see exactly what is happening, whether they’re in the building or across town. This eliminates guesswork and time spent searching for the problem and chasing parts. This kind of time savings adds up fast. One building operator that we worked with had an amazing revelation—that the modernization we performed literally changed his career. By freeing up 20-25 hours a week, he now had time to dig into budgets and bigger-picture improvements he never had before. Remember, you’re not just investing in new technology; you’re investing in your people’s bandwidth. That’s a return on investment that you can feel immediately. It seems easy to delay upgrades by patching what’s already in place. But the longer you wait, the more repair expenses add up, increasing its long-term cost. Aging systems are harder to maintain, less reliable, and more expensive to repair, with replacement parts being difficult to find. Plus, there’s an underlying fear that the band-aids will fail when the conference center is booked with their biggest clients. Paired with smarter controls , modern systems run more efficiently and promote lower maintenance costs. Ancillary or support systems also benefit from less wear and tear, offering a longer lifespan and fewer surprise breakdowns. Investing now can actually help avoid those unplanned emergencies later. It’s not just buying equipment—it’s buying peace of mind. If there’s one lesson the past few years have taught us, it’s that indoor air quality matters. Modern HVAC systems don’t just cool or heat the air; they clean, filter, and monitor it. Better ventilation and filtration reduce allergens, CO 2 buildup, and pollutants, which improves health and productivity. For example, studies show that improved HVAC and ventilation in schools offer meaningful gains in student performance and lower absenteeism. Healthier air means fewer sick days and sharper focus—benefits that can ripple through your entire organization. From a facility perspective, it also means you’re staying ahead of ever-evolving air-quality standards. Investing in modern systems makes it easier to prove compliance and show your commitment to a safe, healthy environment. Flipping your mindset from capital expense to significant investment is challenging, but modernizing your HVAC brings big benefits. When you invest in energy savings, occupant comfort, staff efficiency, reduced maintenance and repair costs, and improved air quality, you’ll find every one of these benefits contributes to your bottom line. It also helps to invest in the right partner, and we are here to help with any questions you have.

Learn more Home > Sustainability > The economic advantages of deploying smart charging and microgrids in buildings Sustainability According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 40% of global energy consumption can be linked directly to buildings. When managing this consumption, building owners face three ongoing challenges: maintaining high building occupant satisfaction levels while controlling energy costs, decarbonizing their building assets on an ongoing basis, and better managing building power capacity issues as the number of EVs connecting to buildings climbs over the next 10 years. Fortunately, today’s technology enables building owners to achieve the long-term profitability and prosperity they desire, despite the challenges of energy and emissions. The question becomes, when should the building owner invest in these new energy technologies, and how will variables such as building type and geography affect the viability of the investment? The Sustainability Research Institute (SRI), has recently completed a comprehensive report entitled Toward net zero buildings: The investment case for smart EV integration . This report provides a detailed review of how two key technologies – smart EV charging and microgrids (a combination of solar generation, battery energy storage, and software)- impact building owner economics, utility peak load management, and tenant satisfaction. This blog reviews the economic impact aspects of the study. The SRI study analyzed the impact of the EV trend in electrified building sites in 2025 (no more fossil boiler) and in 2035. Across 65 use cases, it considered variables such as EV penetration across 13 different geographies and five building types. The study derived EV penetration rates for non-residential buildings from public data. The building types analyzed included large offices, schools, hospitals, retail malls, and small hotels. Building types influence EV penetration rates differently, and researchers projected the number of people arriving by car who use the building in either a long-term (for staff) or short-term (for visitors) capacity. Variables such as climate and energy pricing policies served as key differentiating factors when analyzing the various geographical regions covered in the report study. Access the report: Toward net zero buildings: The investment case for smart EV integration Researchers compiled the study’s results, which are presented in a series of charts and graphs. Key findings include: In the near future, those building owners who choose not to invest in smart charging at this time will likely face issues with grid connection. As the number of EVs continues to increase, traditional (direct) charging system consumption will exceed building power capacity, and the building owner will require investment in costly new transformers to address the issue. In addition, if owners invest in microgrids today, their investment will remain profitable, even as the EV penetration rate continues to climb over the next 10 years. Investments in smart charging and microgrids do not deteriorate the satisfaction levels of building occupants who also happen to be EV drivers. Study findings indicate that EV user satisfaction rates remain high across most building types. Regarding microgrids, satisfaction levels are also high, with nearly all vehicles leaving at their building workplaces with a 90%+ charge. Even under high EV penetration conditions (in 2035), most sectors maintain exceptionally good satisfaction rates, proving that these solutions can scale with demand. The findings from the Sustainability Research Institute make a clear business case for acting now. Smart EV charging and microgrids aren’t just sustainability tools—they’re financial assets that future-proof buildings against rising energy costs and capacity constraints. Early adopters will benefit from stronger tenant and EV user satisfaction, grid stability, and long-term ROI, while those who delay may face escalating costs to retrofit or expand infrastructure later. As EV adoption accelerates, these integrated energy solutions will define the next era of high-performance, low-carbon buildings.

Learn more Home > Buildings > Retail > Small locations, big impact: Driving efficiency and growth across multi-site restaurants Retail Every location in a restaurant franchise, no matter its size, carries an enormous responsibility. Each site is the front line of a brand’s reputation, operational efficiency, and customer experience. Yet, managing them effectively, at scale, presents a unique and complex task for today’s restaurant owners and operational leaders. The challenges are consistent throughout the industry: rising energy costs, unexpected equipment failures that disrupt service, and the immense pressure to deliver a consistent guest experience. These issues are compounded by the need to meet sustainability regulations and achieve environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Managing multiple small and mid-size restaurants requires a new level of strategic oversight. For most multi-site restaurant operators, operational hurdles fall into a few recurring themes: While individually, these may seem minor, when multiplied across locations, they significantly erode profitability and brand consistency. The real strength of a multi-site restaurant franchise often lies in standardization across locations. Each kitchen and dining room offers opportunities to cut costs, boost efficiency, and advance sustainability goals. By addressing systemic issues, like outdated HVAC or refrigeration systems, and using smart tools to plan maintenance and track performance, operators can transform inefficiencies into significant energy and operational savings. This centralized approach also drives brand consistency and simplifies ESG compliance through automated tracking and reporting. Furthermore, comfortable temperatures, clean air, and reliable equipment directly improve guest satisfaction, staff productivity, and food safety, proving that challenges can become a competitive advantage. A case in point is a restaurant chain with 200+ locations that previously operated with little centralized oversight of its energy use or equipment health. After implementing smart monitoring systems, automation, and centralized tools to manage their operations, the restaurant chain reduced equipment breakdowns by 20% and energy costs by 12% in just one year .

Learn more Home > Buildings > Smart security for smart systems: Five principles for achieving true peace of mind Buildings Imagine if a single misplaced command in a software system could bring a global, multi-billion-dollar corporation to its knees in an instant. It’s not a cyberattack; it’s as innocent as one wrong click—an administrator accidentally deleting every employee’s access credentials. The result? Thirty thousand employees locked out of the system, production lines halted, and the entire operation frozen. This isn’t just an abstract scenario that could happen; it’s something that has happened. The immense power of today’s industrial platforms, while bringing vast benefits, can also bring new vulnerability woven into the data and technology that run your business. Smart building systems today integrate access control, video surveillance, and building automation via AI agents. These systems are the necessary strategic engines that drive business efficiency, generate actionable intelligence, and provide comprehensive peace of mind. By leveraging data, these systems can transform from reactive shields into proactive, predictive advantages that safeguard property, people, profits, and the future. At KnightWatch , we’ve seen how these challenges play out across industries, from manufacturing floors to healthcare campuses. The common thread is that leaders aren’t just looking for stronger locks or sharper cameras. They want peace of mind across their entire operation. Based on our experience, we’ve identified five principles that stand out as essential for achieving that peace of mind. Knowing doors were locked and guards were on duty was once considered a solid security plan. Today, a good strategy means confidence that your ecosystem is both physically secure and intelligently managed. Smart systems can now recognize unusual behavior , such as a crowd gathering where one usually wouldn’t, detecting when a bag or object is left alone in a public space, or a valuable asset disappearing from its usual location. This approach to security demonstrates foresight, as insights enable organizations to act before incidents escalate. In boardrooms and with insurers, the ability to show predictive awareness is becoming a benchmark of operational maturity. The most powerful shift in modern security is its integration with core business operations. For example, at one manufacturing facility, an employee’s badge swipe did more than open a door; it clocked them in, updated shift schedules, and, based on credentials and real-time factory needs, assigned a workstation. The result was a system that improved efficiency and generated a stream of operational intelligence: managers could forecast daily output, identify gaps, and even predict revenue with greater accuracy. But the same integrations that enable these insights can also introduce fragility. In this scenario, when a network outage froze this system, production ground to a halt. No one could clock in, access schedules, or receive work assignments. The resulting hours of downtime cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Here, the Achilles’ heel wasn’t the integration itself, but the lack of continuity safeguards. Without redundant networks or manual overrides, any efficiency gains can unravel in minutes. Resilience must be designed into the system from the start, treating redundancy and backup as strategic safeguards for continuity. Organizations often recognize the value of proactive security only after an avoidable loss. A regional logistics company postponed installing cameras in a back lot to save on upfront costs. Within a few months, several vehicles were stolen from that unmonitored area—resulting in losses approaching three-quarters of a million dollars. Insurance eventually reimbursed the company, but premiums and operational costs soared. It was a costly lesson in false economy. By contrast, a large retail chain invested in smart surveillance with license plate recognition , heat mapping, and video analytics. Their analysis showed the system could pay for itself within two years, significantly reduce customer disputes through verifiable footage, and improve staff productivity. Security, like any other investment, deserves evaluation through ROI, total cost of ownership, and long-term risk reduction. With smarter systems also come increased concerns about privacy. Employees often fear “big brother” surveillance, and some industries impose strict requirements on data storage and facial recognition. Yet customers, insurers, and regulators increasingly expect advanced protections to be in place. This is an executive, not a back-office, decision. Security policies and dedication to cybersecurity have a direct impact on customer trust, brand reputation, and investor confidence. Transparent communication—making clear that systems are there to protect, not police—will define which organizations earn stakeholder trust in the long run. Every system—from access control, surveillance, automation, cybersecurity, to analytics—creates ripple effects that extend far beyond its immediate function. But systems alone don’t create peace of mind. Trust does. And that trust is earned through technical capability, transparency, and responsiveness when things go wrong. Tomorrow’s business decisions may impact the function of the technology systems of yesterday. That’s why credibility in this field comes from showing up: explaining what happened, why it happened, and why it won’t happen again with a clear plan of resolution. In that sense, our role as an integrator is not just delivering systems but serving as a trusted partner in resilience. For organizations navigating the rising complexity of smart systems, the real question is how to ensure resilience. We’re here to help leaders turn that challenge into confidence.

Learn more Home > Digital Transformation > Interoperability: The key to smarter hospitals and healthier outcomes Digital Transformation Hospitals often operate with a patchwork of legacy IT /OT systems built for a different era of healthcare. These systems, while reliable, were not designed to accommodate the demands of modern digital tools or the need for seamless data exchange. This creates significant obstacles when introducing modern technologies, such as patient engagement platforms , digital whiteboards, or room controls, into existing spaces and associated infrastructures. These additions can lead to isolated systems that fail to communicate effectively, undermining their potential value and impact. The challenges are compounded by the aging infrastructure many hospitals are currently operating within. Legacy systems often require frequent maintenance and are prone to downtime, which can’t happen in critical environments like healthcare, further complicating efforts to modernize and impacting reliability. The cost of maintaining older systems, coupled with the effort needed to integrate them with newer technologies, can strain both CapEx and OpEx resources. These limitations are particularly pronounced in facilities where IT/OT departments are already stretched thin and may lack the specialized resources required to manage advanced technology integrations. Regulatory compliance also presents another layer of difficulty. Healthcare providers adhere to strict data security and privacy standards, such as HIPAA and NIST cyber security requirements, which demand meticulous attention to how information flows across systems. When legacy systems are involved, ensuring compliance can be particularly challenging, as older platforms may not meet current security or interoperability standards. As a result, any new system must be carefully vetted to ensure it can interface securely with existing technology without introducing vulnerabilities. Adding to the complexity is the sheer diversity of tools that hospitals now use to manage care. From electronic health records (EHRs) to patient room controls, these systems often come from different vendors, each with their own proprietary methods of operation. While some vendors are moving toward adopting standardized protocols like fast health interoperability resources (FHIR) and Health Level Seven (HL7), many systems still rely on unique interfaces that complicate integration efforts. This creates a situation where hospitals must juggle multiple systems that don’t naturally “speak the same language,” increasing the risk of inefficiencies, errors, and failures. Without a deliberate focus on interoperability from the outset, hospitals risk implementing solutions that create more problems than they solve. Each new addition to the IT/OT ecosystem must be assessed not just for its individual capabilities but for how well it can operate with the broader system to ensure seamless operation. The distinction between integration and interoperability is not merely technical; it is foundational to how healthcare systems operate and evolve. Integration establishes connections between systems, but interoperability enables these systems to collaborate effectively and exchange data in meaningful ways. This deeper level of connection ensures information flows with purpose, supporting clinical workflows, efficient building infrastructure, and a holistic view of patient’s journey digitally. One of the keys to achieving interoperability lies in the use of standardized application programming interfaces (APIs). Companies that rely on standards-based APIs experience less burden in establishing and maintaining connections than those using proprietary APIs , with fewer reporting substantial effort when using standards-based methods. This is particularly significant for hospitals working with multiple vendors, as proprietary APIs can create bottlenecks and limit scalability. The adoption of FHIR standards, for example, is growing especially as hospitals increasingly rely on EHR from various vendors. Since companies that integrate with various EHR vendors report more extensive use of FHIR standards , this trend demonstrates a shift toward open frameworks that prioritize compatibility and scalability. By leveraging these standardized approaches, healthcare providers build IT ecosystems that not only function efficiently today but can also adapt to future needs. Similarly, BIM provides a data standard for all things building-related from lighting and window shade controls in patient rooms to rooftop chillers and HVAC systems serving the entire facility. These systems are vital for supporting a healthy environment within the hospital and they also can yield opportunities for substantial energy and cost savings when coupled with analytics and building control systems. A critical aspect of interoperability is its impact on patient care. Effective data exchange ensures that clinicians have access to complete and up-to-date information, which enhances decision-making and reduces the risk of errors. It also allows hospitals to integrate advanced tools like patient engagement systems into existing workflows, maximizing their value and enhancing patient experience and clinical operations without creating silos or redundancy. When systems communicate effectively, the result is not just operational efficiency but also improved outcomes for patients and care teams alike. Effective interoperability in healthcare begins with a solid foundation of standardized open protocols that enable seamless data exchange and collaboration across systems. As noted, FHIR and BIM are two examples. Another critical factor in achieving interoperability is the selection of technology providers that align with open standards and offer comprehensive, end-to-end solutions. Hospitals that work with vendors committed to these standards benefit from more consistent data flow and fewer integration challenges, allowing them to better focus on patients. It’s also essential to take a long-term view and choose systems that allow for modular upgrades and compatibility with other platforms. Open, non-proprietary architectures reduce long-term maintenance burdens and make it easier to incorporate innovative technologies as they emerge. For instance, Epic’s interoperability capabilities have enabled hospitals to connect critical data points across administrative and clinical systems. As Epic’s capabilities are utilized to scale interventions at multiple sites , healthcare providers have successfully enhanced operational workflows and clinical care coordination without compromising existing infrastructure. Finally, fostering interoperability requires a strategic approach to vendor relationships and ongoing IT/OT investments. Establishing collaborative partnerships with technology providers ensures access to the necessary expertise and support for navigating the complexities of system integration. This approach not only improves the initial implementation of new tools but also builds a more adaptable technology ecosystem that can evolve alongside the hospital’s needs. By prioritizing solutions built around interoperability, hospitals position themselves to meet the demands of modern healthcare delivery today while maintaining operational resilience and patient-focused care ready for the future. When hospitals successfully implement interoperable systems, they streamline workflows and enhance clinical decision-making. For example, the widespread adoption of patient engagement tools has made it easier for hospitals to share clinical information with patients. This, in turn, supports a more collaborative, more personal approach to care. By avoiding data silos, healthcare facilities can also reduce administrative burdens, freeing up staff to focus on priorities like population health initiatives and predictive analytics. When systems exchange information seamlessly, hospitals can aggregate and analyze data to identify trends, anticipate future needs, and make more informed decisions at both the individual and population levels. This not only aids in delivering better care but also positions facilities to meet value-based care goals, which increasingly emphasize outcomes and efficiency. Operational costs also see a marked improvement with interoperability. As systems are better able to communicate, hospitals face fewer technical barriers that can lead to delays, maintenance needs, or resource-intensive workarounds. This not only reduces downtime but also helps optimize resource allocation. Facilities relying on aging IT/OT infrastructure can particularly benefit from this, as interoperability minimizes the strain new technologies might otherwise place on older systems. Finally, prioritizing interoperability fosters greater flexibility and scalability within a hospital’s IT/OT ecosystem. By implementing systems that can adapt technology, healthcare providers are better equipped to handle future standards and technology challenges and innovations without extensive overhauls. This positions hospitals to remain agile in an ever-changing industry, ensuring their investments in technology deliver long-term value. With modern healthcare placing an ever-growing emphasis on digital tools, smart building systems and patient-centered approaches, interoperability is no longer a “nice-to-have” but a critical requirement for staying competitive and effective in care delivery.

Learn more Home > Buildings > Aging buildings, smarter systems: Why it’s time to modernize HVAC controls Buildings “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?” can be a common refrain when it comes to decisions regarding decades-old HVAC control systems. However, while aging manual equipment—be it standalone electric thermostats or building-wide pneumatic designs—might be functional, it could still be creating a significant budget hit for building owners and operators. The obvious financial downside to sticking with the status quo is simply high monthly running costs. Because old equipment offers minimal controllability, it’s often left in “set-and-forget” mode unless someone remembers to change it. This means it could be running 24/7, regardless of occupancy. This practice leads to wasted energy and needlessly expensive energy bills. But excessive energy use is just one of the ways an old installation can impact the bottom line: Investing in upgraded controls can address all these issues, from costs to comfort, and free up facility staff to address priorities beyond solving frequent temperature complaints. Because our attention is so easily drawn to new construction, it’s easy to overlook the fact that a large proportion of nonresidential U.S. buildings are aged. According to the U.S. Department of Energy , 50% of the nation’s commercial buildings were constructed before 1980. Public K-12 schools have an average age of 49 years , and religious structures are the oldest of all. For these buildings, a recent informal survey on social media found a median age of 67 , while the average age, heavily weighted by a significant number of significantly old buildings, was 92! Of course, old buildings can have envelope problems that take priority when it comes to maintenance budgets. Replacing a leaking roof, for instance, will require immediate attention, given the potential damage that could result if it were ignored. However, while exterior issues are crucial to maintaining a building’s structure, its systems, particularly HVAC equipment and controls, are vital to ensuring its usability. And often these systems are left at the bottom of the list when it comes to budgetary priorities. This is unfortunate because modernizations can pay for themselves in multiple ways over time, especially through the switch from manual thermostats and pneumatic controls to direct digital controls (DDC) that automate operations. These installations also enable greater visibility into how mechanical equipment is operating, making it easier to spot early warning signs and address issues before they become problems. So, where do these opportunities for payback lie? Consider the ways life with your buildings could change with an HVAC controls upgrade: There’s no doubt that HVAC modernizations can be a big investment. But organizations have options that can help make financing these improvements easier, using the resulting savings to help pay the bill. One approach is staging installations over time. So, for example, electric-to-pneumatic transducers can be used to help bring DDC oversight to existing pneumatic control systems. With this approach, a new electronic controller sends digital signals to a valve-connected transducer that then “translates” the signal into a mechanical open/close operation. The pneumatic equipment will still likely need replacement eventually. Still, this move can be part of a strategic plan to bank utility and maintenance savings to pay for a more extensive upgrade down the road. The first important step, regardless of the plan your organization is considering, is to initiate a conversation with HVAC controls professionals you can trust. Look for experts who emphasize relationships over one-time sales, because you’ll continue to need support even after new systems are commissioned. Change management will also need to be a part of this process. More than just learning a new equipment manual, facilities staff will need help understanding what their roles will be as new systems kick into operation. And other occupants might need help learning how life with automated, sensor-controlled HVAC will differ from the set-it-and-forget-it operations they’ve gotten used to. In the end, though, these investments can help future-proof your buildings while also reducing their carbon footprints, as energy savings translate into reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. In these ways, adding automation to your HVAC operations is more than a way to cut energy costs–it’s a strategic investment in your buildings’ future. Want to continue this conversation?

Maybe it’s a failed electronic lock, or a malfunctioning HVAC unit in a sterile environment. In a modern, integrated building , these problems can cascade, triggering an operational, financial, or safety crisis. Waiting for something to break isn’t a strategy; it’s a gamble. And as the saying goes , “A gambler always loses…” Smart maintenance is how we stop rolling the dice. By moving beyond break/fix to proactive services , such as continuous updates, predictive monitoring, and service agreements that unify security, automation, energy, and fire protection, organizations can make their buildings more resilient. I believe that maintenance isn’t a line-item expense, but rather a strategic investment: it safeguards trust, fuels efficiency, and keeps smart buildings living up to their name. In fact, these strategies can cut overall maintenance costs by 18-25% and reduce unplanned downtime by up to 50%. Smart maintenance prevents emergencies, rather than just responding to them. The approach includes: This combination keeps systems resilient and clients confident that their operations are secure. Many view service plans as an extended warranty: an unnecessary cost. However, this misses the point. A smart service plan is a predictable operational investment that protects against unpredictable downtime costs. Failures aren’t just repair bills; they mean lost productivity, business disruption, and sometimes safety liabilities. A proactive plan transforms technology from an unpredictable expense into a managed asset. By covering everything from software to physical systems, service agreements ensure your building automation, security, and life safety systems are always working for you, not against you. It’s peace of mind that delivers value beyond what insurance alone can provide. Many providers treat building systems as silos. At Knight Watch, we believe in taking a different approach, bringing fire prevention, security, building automation, and energy management under one roof. When we own the ecosystem, that means no more finger-pointing between the security vendor and the HVAC vendor. If it’s in your building, it’s our problem to solve. This integration also enables smarter insights . Our single-pane-of-glass dashboards and monitoring platforms leverage AI to analyze service tickets, spot recurring issues, and predict failures before they happen. Our goal is simple: tell clients we’ve already fixed a problem, not to wait for their call. The impact of smart maintenance varies by industry, but the outcomes are universal: enhanced safety, increased efficiency, and improved resilience. These examples show how proactive service adapts to unique operational demands, keeping critical systems reliable. One of our long-term healthcare clients illustrates the value of smart maintenance. We partnered with them to define standards and workflows across multiple facilities, enabling them to establish a consistent framework for safety and efficiency. Proactive agreements, including database backups, real-time alerts, and dedicated on-call teams, dramatically reduced downtime. Their leadership group now sees maintenance not as a defensive cost but as an essential part of their patient care strategy. For us, smart maintenance is built on trust. We deeply respect that our customers know their businesses better than anyone else. So, when they hand us their critical security, safety, energy, and automation systems, they’re placing confidence in our ability to keep them running. We earn that trust by being transparent and showing up when it matters most. As I often remind our team, business relationships are no different than personal ones: honesty, integrity, and accountability are the foundation. When we do have to deliver difficult news, it includes the understanding that we also have the solution. The true power of a smart building isn’t just in the sophisticated technology installed on day one; it’s in the intelligent, proactive maintenance strategy that ensures those systems deliver value for years to come. As systems grow more complex and AI puts more data at our fingertips, the real differentiator will be having a trusted partner who can manage, interpret, and act on that information.

Learn more Home > Buildings > From visibility to value: The executive blueprint for built environment transformation Buildings In today’s built environment, the convergence of people, data democratization, and modern asset management platforms is not just a digital ambition – it is a strategic necessity. For executives overseeing complex portfolios, aligning these elements unlocks more than operational efficiency. It delivers measurable value: sharper capital expenditure forecasts, proactive asset lifecycle planning, and enterprise-wide visibility that drives confident, data-backed decisions. Transformation begins with people. Not just skilled individuals, but empowered teams aligned to a common mission. As the Deloitte IDO Playbook outlines, becoming an Insight-Driven Organisation (IDO) requires embedding strategy, people, data trust, and automation into everyday workflows. This shift demands leadership clarity, cross-functional collaboration, and a culture that values insight over instinct. For executives, this means investing in talent structures that break down silos and foster shared accountability across asset, finance, and operations teams. When people are aligned with purpose and supported by the right tools, they become the engine of built environment transformation. Data democratization is not about giving everyone access to everything – it is about giving the right people access to the right data at the right time. In the built environment, this translates to enabling asset managers, engineers, and sustainability leaders to work from a unified source of truth. Outdated and siloed systems perpetuate a lack of visibility, making it nearly impossible to forecast capital needs accurately or plan asset lifecycles effectively. Modern organizations must eliminate these blind spots by investing in interoperable systems that surface insights, not just information. When integrated into a broader intelligent technology architecture – alongside advanced analytics and independent data layer platforms – modern IWMS (Integrated Workplace Management Solutions) platforms become strategic enablers. They deliver real-time insights, elevate decision-making, and offer executives a comprehensive, actionable view of asset performance across the portfolio. The benefits are compelling: For leaders, IWMS platforms are no longer optional – they are foundational to delivering on performance, compliance, and sustainability mandates. When people, data, and platforms are aligned, built environment transformation becomes tangible. Teams shift from reactive to strategic. Systems evolve from fragmented to intelligent. And digital initiatives move from pilot projects to enterprise-wide value creation. This is the executive blueprint: align talent with purpose, democratize data with intent, and deploy platforms that scale insight. The result? A built environment that is not only visible – but valuable. To learn more, visit our Planon IWMS page. All fields are required.

Learn more Home > Buildings > Energy audits: The first step to achieving real energy savings Buildings Imagine if, at every doctor’s visit, they just gave you a quick glance and sent you on your way if you appeared healthy—no questions, no tests, or deeper digging into how you’ve been feeling. You likely wouldn’t stand much of a chance of improving your health by ignoring what’s happening inside your body. That’s what happens with many buildings and their energy use. In my first blog, we explored energy benchmarking—a useful way to compare your building’s performance to others and find quick wins to cut costs. But benchmarking alone only scratches the surface. Energy audits go further, exploring your building’s day-to-day operations to uncover inefficiencies and patterns you may not have known existed. Like a complete physical workup for your health, an energy audit can reveal what’s going on beneath the surface—turning a one-time snapshot into the starting point for long-term, measurable energy savings. So, if, like many organizations, energy costs have become a big budget target, an audit that includes real-time equipment performance monitoring and benchmarking against similar facilities is the best way to start your journey toward significant cost reductions. When talking with consultants about conducting an energy audit, it’s important to understand the level of detail you’re looking for. To help define expectations, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) has outlined three levels of energy audits, based on their intensity: A Level 1 audit can provide a certain level of immediate savings by, say, suggesting some easy adjustments to scheduled runtime or lighting levels. But the significant cost reductions come as owners and managers move into Level 2 and 3 investigations. These can even be used together, with the results of a Level 2 effort identifying operations or equipment that would be good targets for Level 3 attention. For example, a Level 2 audit could find temperature and humidity conditions that aren’t meeting Energy Star guidelines or compare unfavorably to the engineer’s data collection. At that point, auditors might outline possible improvements to control systems, along with a range of projected savings and payback periods, to address the issues. But it would take a closer Level 3 investigation to narrow those projections down to figures both the auditor and client can trust. Energy auditors in a Level 3 project take a detailed look at facility operations. This could include: A fantastic tool to utilize when performing energy audits is a digital twin . By pairing the data gathered in the audit with the consumption and cost information from related energy bills, auditors can use software to create a virtual version of the facilities. Here, they have a replica of the facility and its operations, including a 3D model of the facility’s mechanical systems. The digital twin, calibrated to reflect real-world energy use, allows the auditors to simulate, test, and validate potential energy efficiency improvements before implementing changes. So, for example, they can see how strategies like setting back temperature setpoints in the evening could impact their bills. And, similarly, the digital twin could highlight that another proposed change might not offer the financial payback that engineers initially thought. And it also helps identify equipment upgrades or replacements that could make real improvements possible—like, say, replacing manual controls with digital models that automate operations to help lock savings in place. The goal of a digital twin is to create the most accurate representation possible to make precise recommendations for energy efficiency projects. What customers receive at the end of the process can vary by company. But the most important information includes action items, related costs, and the savings-to-investment ratio estimates. If the audit provider is also the contractor who would be performing the improvements, that deliverable can become a commitment, of sorts, of what customers can expect once a project is complete. It also becomes a baseline document as updated systems are commissioned and put into daily operation. But making such an installation a long-term success doesn’t end with a project’s completion. Owners and facility managers considering such an investment need to ask prospective installers about the support they provide, including: Bringing facility operations up to modern standards can provide big benefits, both in lower costs and improved conditions for building occupants. But these are expensive projects, and to ensure money is only being spent where it’s needed requires a clear understanding of current conditions. And the work doesn’t end with a project’s ribbon cutting— watchful eyes are needed to help ensure performance doesn’t start drifting back to previous levels. So, while a detailed audit is a necessary foundation for success, it’s not a guarantee. That’s why it’s important to do your due diligence when seeking this kind of engineering support.

Learn more Home > Buildings > From switchboards to smart buildings: The quiet revolution powering Australia’s electrification push Buildings In the electrical room of a mid-tier office building, an unremarkable, outdated switchboard hums quietly. It’s inconspicuous, yet a vital part of the annual $5.6 trillion investment in the global energy transition—a quiet shift transforming Australia’s buildings into dynamic, data-driven ecosystems. The future of electrification is being shaped in switchboards, where analog panels are being revitalised as digital nerve centers. Australia’s commercial building industry is at a key turning point . Sustainability requirements are becoming stricter. Tenants are asking for smarter, more sustainable spaces. Energy prices are climbing rapidly. However, many buildings remain rooted in infrastructure designed for a very different time. That’s where modern switchboards come in—the hidden backbones of smart buildings, integrating energy monitoring, heating, ventilation, and air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, and Electric Vehicle (EV) readiness into the core of a commercial property. And while many owners view these upgrades as costs rather than opportunities, at GSTEC , we believe it’s time to shift perspectives. Electrification is an investment, not an expense and it forms the foundation of a building’s long-term competitive advantage. The electrification transformation began with a nudge. Recent updates to Australian switchboard manufacturing standards are forcing long-overdue upgrades. But compliance is just the floor—the ceiling is game-changing efficiency . Switchboards have evolved from basic distribution panels into intelligent, connected systems. Once simply routing power and protecting circuits, they’re now becoming IoT-enabled nodes at the heart of smart buildings. A fully digitized, IoT-capable switchboard can do more than monitor loads. It can segment consumption by system or tenant, support predictive maintenance, identify power quality issues in real-time, and integrate seamlessly with energy management systems (EMS) and building management systems (BMS) platforms. The result is improved visibility, faster response times, and a stronger foundation for efficiency, compliance, and future-ready performance. One standout example is Aurora Place , a 49,000 m² tower in Sydney’s CBD. GSTEC led a seamless upgrade of the BMS/EMS and main switchboards, complete with Schneider Air Circuit Breakers, without disrupting tenants over 41 floors. The result was improved tenant comfort, higher energy ratings, and peer acknowledgement, including the 2022 Schneider EcoXpert Global Project of the Year and the 2023 NECA NSW Commercial Medium Award. We’ve found that the best outcomes start in the design room. In too many buildings, upgrades unfold in silos: electrical teams manage one track, mechanical contractors another, and energy reporting is bolted on late. The result is often systems that don’t talk to each other, and performance that underdelivers. We regularly encounter this fragmentation. HVAC upgrades may proceed without digital infrastructure. EMS platforms arrive too late to capture meaningful data. EV readiness gets treated as a separate project altogether. When GSTEC is involved early, these threads are aligned from the start. Electrical and mechanical upgrades become part of one strategic playbook, and complexity is reduced before it ever takes root. Because budgets can be tight, it’s important to work smarter. Switchboard upgrades are often seen as unremarkable, a response to aging gear or shifting standards. But, when positioned strategically, they unlock a great deal more. Bundled with HVAC renewals or sustainability retrofits, modern switchboards enable segmentation, performance tracking, and energy visualization. They support compliance, National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) targets, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, and long-term asset value. So, reframing CapEx is key. These aren’t sunk costs; they will be revenue drivers. A building’s stronger energy profile leads to higher occupancy rates, longer lease terms, lower risk, and even lower insurance premiums. At GSTEC, our strength lies in our capacity to link mechanical and electrical systems into a single, intelligent network. That’s especially true for HVAC-linked switchboards, where mechanical upgrades provide the perfect opportunity to integrate digital capabilities. Through equipment-level metering on pumps, fans, and chillers, GSTEC enables real-time energy tracking. That data feeds into building management systems, where it powers strategies like load scheduling, peak shaving, and predictive maintenance. Think of the switchboard not as an isolated upgrade, but as the brainstem of a smarter organism where every system contributes to a coordinated whole— and where electrification strategies can be implemented seamlessly . Energy reporting has evolved from a compliance checkbox into a business asset . Tenants want transparency. Investors want performance. Regulators want proof. But effective reporting begins with infrastructure. GSTEC designs architectures that integrate smart meters with EMS and BMS platforms, transforming raw data into live dashboards and predictive insights. Whether benchmarking against NABERS or tracking emissions in real time, the visibility is immediate and actionable. For building owners, this meets mandates, yes, but also builds trust, helps secure premium leases, and stays ahead of the market’s next evolution. Modernization efforts are often treated as separate line items: switchboards here, HVAC there, and EV readiness somewhere down the road. But the buildings that succeed are those that tie these threads together. Here’s the roadmap GSTEC recommends: Early collaboration is the key to smarter, more future-ready buildings.

Learn more Home > Buildings > Boost HVAC efficiency and cut energy costs with smart actuators and PIBCVs in commercial buildings Buildings According to the International Energy Agency, buildings (commercial, residential, and new construction) account for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions . While commercial buildings alone contribute a smaller share (~6.6%), they remain a significant source of energy consumption. Within these facilities, HVAC systems are a substantial energy draw, responsible for 24–40% of total energy use . That makes HVAC a prime target for energy savings, especially as building owners face mounting pressure to meet net-zero targets and avoid costly non-compliance penalties. But improving HVAC efficiency isn’t as simple as turning a dial. Many systems rely on complex hydronic networks where managing water pressure, temperature, and flow is a delicate balancing act. That’s where pressure-independent balancing control valves (PIBCVs) and smart actuators come into play. They offer a powerful, intelligent solution that boosts performance and comfort and can also deliver energy savings of 20% or more. A smart actuator is an advanced device that combines traditional actuation with control algorithms, connectivity features, and support for external sensing, enabling it to perform intelligent control functions directly at the valve level. When applied to Pressure Independent Balancing Control Valves (PIBCVs), smart actuators manage hydronic flow and thermal energy delivery with high precision. These actuators continuously monitor variables such as flow rate, temperature differential, valve position, and energy consumption. These often use connected sensors like supply and return temperature probes. With this data, they can implement advanced strategies like Delta T Management to maintain optimal coil performance. It can also prevent issues such as low Delta T syndrome, which can reduce system efficiency and overburden central equipment. Smart actuators also offer diagnostic features that detect problems like control loop instability, valve blockage, or improper flow rates early. This enables proactive maintenance and reduces downtime. An additional benefit is the availability of spare input/output (I/O) points on some models. These can be used to connect and monitor other HVAC-related variables—such as differential pressure, occupancy sensors, or pipe temperatures. This further extends the actuator’s role in overall system management. A major advantage of these devices is their ability to communicate using open protocols like BACnet or Modbus. This makes integration with building management systems (BMS) seamless. Through these protocols, smart actuators transmit a wealth of real-time data, including energy metrics, system performance trends, alarms, and diagnostics. This transparency enables facility managers to monitor system health continuously, fine-tune performance, and respond quickly to anomalies or inefficiencies. Beyond data sharing, smart actuators contribute to fault prevention by identifying conditions such as stuck valves, abnormal flow rates, or temperature imbalances before they escalate into system failures. Some models can even trigger automated responses or alerts when thresholds are breached, supporting predictive maintenance, and reducing unplanned downtime. Additionally, smart actuators can be remotely configured through the BMS to operate in different control modes—such as Power Control, or Delta T Management—without the need for manual intervention. They also allow dynamic adjustment of the PIBCV’s design or maximum flow rate remotely. This provides the flexibility to adapt zone capacity based on occupancy patterns or seasonal loads. This level of control supports adaptive strategies, simplifies commissioning, and enhances the long-term efficiency and reliability of the hydronic system. They are especially valuable in environments with critical heating and cooling demands, such as data centers. In these settings, maintaining consistent cooling is essential. Computer equipment generates significant heat and must stay within specific temperature ranges to operate efficiently and avoid thermal damage. Data centers typically rely on computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units that must run continuously, 24/7/365, leaving no room for downtime. PIBCVs provide localized stability to the CRAC water distribution system in these conditions. Using an associated smart actuator, data can be collated and used for advanced analytics to identify and remediate potential issues. This ensures high uptime. In fact, many CRAC units built by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) include PIBCVs and smart actuators as a core part of their technology. However, they can also be added during the design and installation phases if they are not part of the core equipment package.

Learn more Home > Buildings > Smart modernizations, real savings: How strategic building automation saved one district $800K a year Buildings When it comes to modernizing aging systems, school administrators often approach facility purchases as simple, like-for-like replacements. However, with careful planning and a focus on efficiency, these acquisitions can often pay for themselves—and then some—in lower energy bills and maintenance costs over their entire lifespan. By considering these long-term savings, decision-makers can ensure that modernizations enhance current operations while providing lasting financial and operational benefits. For example, today’s field devices and systems can: These are all factors that facility managers for one central Illinois school district considered in their efforts to control costs and boost performance for the buildings they manage. In 2017, facilities managers at McLean County Unit School District 5, based in Normal, Illinois, recognized the urgent need for operational improvements. Like many school districts, they were managing buildings of varying ages, many of which had outdated systems that no longer performed as originally intended. Maintenance teams were overwhelmed by daily comfort complaints, and the absence of centralized controls meant technicians were constantly dispatched to manually adjust valves, dampers, and actuators across 30 facilities. Rising energy costs were making energy bills unsustainable, further straining the budget and diverting funds from other building improvements. To address these challenges, district leadership launched an initiative to maximize building efficiency, using ENERGY STAR® certification guidelines as a benchmark. Let’s dive deeper into how they achieved their goals. Alpha Controls & Services was fortunate to be chosen as the partner to help the district develop a comprehensive plan to automate its building management systems, thereby lowering costs by improving efficiency and comfort. Facilities staff began rolling out mechanical and controls improvements in their least efficient buildings, including: The resulting energy-cost savings were then rolled into efforts to spread improvements to additional schools in their portfolio. Today, 13 schools are running new scheduling software in collaboration with school staff to enable even further savings. The partnership remains active through monthly building-level Energy Star ratings reviews, with properties that aren’t earning at least a 75 being targeted for improvement. Within seven years, this upgrade investment has: This push is also now being used as a learning opportunity, with one junior high school now considering a “virtual mechanical room”—a live energy dashboard that allows students to explore building operations through real-time energy data. This effort serves as a model for what districts across the country can achieve by partnering with energy solutions experts to plan and implement automation-focused strategies that bring utility costs under control. The issues McLean County faced are not unique to its school system. K-12 districts, universities, libraries, and other public and nonprofit facilities face similar challenges— maintaining safe, comfortable buildings while managing costs. Here are four factors to keep in mind when your organization is looking to replace or modernize equipment: Developing a strategic relationship with an energy-focused partner can help ensure your organization sees the same returns McLean County’s schools have earned.

Instead of equating innovation with novelty, it invites architects to engage with what is already there; to read the city as a palimpsest of histories, resources, and social relations. The act of building less becomes a question of judgment rather than capability, of knowing when to intervene and when to step back. In this space of restraint, architecture reclaims its critical agency not as the art of making, but as the discipline of making through less .

Related Article Deconstruct, Do Not Demolish: The Practice of Reuse of Materials in Architecture Building Less, Designing More For much of the twentieth century, modern architecture equated progress with construction. Cities became laboratories for growth , and demolition was seen as a necessary step toward renewal. The rhetoric of ""starting fresh"" shaped postwar reconstruction, industrial expansion, and late-modernist urban planning. Yet this logic — of erasing to rebuild — has come under increasing scrutiny. Demolition disperses the carbon already stored in structures and triggers new emissions through replacement materials; it also generates large volumes of waste that are difficult to reinsert into productive cycles. Beyond environmental impact, it breaks social continuities: tenants are displaced, everyday networks are interrupted, and the memory embedded in the city is lost.

In contrast, architects such as Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal have grounded their work in the principle ""never demolish, never remove, never replace"" . Instead of treating the existing as an obstacle, they approach it as a starting point. At the Grand Parc renewal in Bordeaux , they retained postwar housing blocks and worked with their structural rhythm to graft winter gardens and generous balconies onto the facades, improving thermal performance and expanding domestic space without evacuating residents. Interior layouts were reconfigured with light-touch operations, bringing daylight deeper into the plan and allowing flexible occupation over time.

Interior layouts were reconfigured with light-touch operations, bringing daylight deeper into the plan and allowing flexible occupation over time. This approach is consistent across other works by the studio. At the Tour Bois-le-Prêtre , developed with Frédéric Druot , the team refused demolition proposals and instead enlarged the building envelope with prefabricated extensions, creating new rooms, loggias, and winter gardens for each apartment while upgrading services and insulation. The reuse of the structural frame preserved the building's embodied resources and avoided the disruption of relocation. At the FRAC Nord–Pas de Calais , they maintained the vast hall of a former shipyard and added a simple, translucent volume alongside it, allowing the existing industrial space to remain active for exhibitions and public programs while the new volume provided controlled environmental conditions. But even when building from scratch, as in the School of Architecture in Nantes , the strategy is similar — designing a generous, open structure with intermediate spaces that can be occupied in multiple ways, minimizing fixed partitions and maximizing the capacity for future change, they run a consistent method: identify what works, reinforce the structure that holds value, and add only what is necessary to unlock new use.

A similar strategy can be found in the work of Rotor Deconstruction . Founded as a spin-off of the Brussels-based architecture collective Rotor , the initiative specializes in the careful dismantling and redistribution of building components. Rather than treating demolition as an endpoint, they view it as the beginning of a new material cycle. By cataloguing, cleaning, and reselling salvaged elements — from façade panels to door handles — Rotor creates a secondary market that challenges the linear logic of construction. Their operations are both logistical and cultural as they reveal the hidden labor embedded in materials and demonstrate that reuse can be systematic, not marginal. In doing so, they redefine what it means to design, shifting the architect's role from maker to mediator, from producer of new objects to curator of existing ones.

Taken together, these projects clarify why transformation has become a credible alternative to replacement. By keeping primary frames, foundations, and circulation cores, they shorten construction time, reduce material throughput, and preserve the social life of a place. What was once seen as a limitation — the constraint of an existing structure — becomes a source of invention. In this model, authorship shifts from imposition to calibration. The designer listens to the building's geometry, traces of occupation, and structural logic; the intervention emerges from those conditions rather than against them.

Design Through Absence Restraint does not mean passivity. It requires precision, judgment, and imagination, the ability to intervene only where necessary and to design with minimal means. Few projects embody this more eloquently than David Chipperfield's restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin . Restraint does not mean passivity. It requires precision, judgment, and imagination, the ability to intervene only where necessary and to design with minimal means. Few projects embody this more eloquently than David Chipperfield's restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin . He inherited a ruin. Severely damaged during World War II and left untouched for more than half a century, the building existed as both a cultural void and a monument to loss. Chipperfield's intervention, developed with conservation specialist Julian Harrap , did not aim to restore the museum to its pre-war appearance nor to disguise its destruction. Instead, it sought to stabilize and complete what remained, preserving the building's historical layers as tangible records of time. New elements — staircases, columns, and wall surfaces — were added only where structurally essential, using materials such as pale brick, concrete, and oak that quietly differentiate themselves from the original fabric. The new never imitates the old, and the old is never idealized; both coexist in a carefully balanced composition of absence and presence. He inherited a ruin.

This understanding of design as measured intervention also defines Sala Beckett , a project by Flores & Prats that transformed a decaying cooperative building into a theatre and cultural laboratory. Rather than stripping the structure back to a neutral shell, the architects preserved the residue of previous lives: faded frescoes, cracked tiles, remnants of stage sets. The new spatial organization unfolds around these traces, treating them as actors in the ongoing narrative of the building. Walls were patched rather than repainted, doors were adjusted instead of replaced, and new partitions were built as reversible frameworks. The building's imperfections were not concealed but illuminated, revealing how memory can coexist with use, and how fragility can become a form of strength — maximum effect through minimum action.

Both projects articulate a way of working defined not by addition, but by calibration. They resist the modernist impulse to erase and remake, replacing it with a patient search for continuity. Their power lies not in visual spectacle but in what remains unsaid — the voids, the silences, the unaltered walls that hold the weight of history. This economy of gesture transforms limitation into aesthetic intelligence. The less that is added, the more the existing fabric speaks. When seen together, these approaches reveal that absence can be as expressive as form. It is an architecture of patience and empathy, in which restraint becomes the medium through which meaning is constructed. In a time when excess has exhausted its possibilities, these practices show that doing less — and doing it well — may be the most radical act of all.

The Aesthetics of the Incomplete Restraint also redefines aesthetics. The architecture of the twentieth century often pursued completeness. In contrast, many contemporary works find expression in incompleteness, embracing the unfinished, the layered, and the imperfect. This sensibility acknowledges that buildings, like cities, are never static; they exist in continuous negotiation with time, decay, and use. Restraint also redefines aesthetics.

This sensibility acknowledges that buildings, like cities, are never static; they exist in continuous negotiation with time, decay, and use. Peter Zumthor's Kolumba Museum captures this idea with remarkable clarity. Built upon the ruins of a bombed Gothic church, the project preserves the remains not as relics to be protected behind glass, but as integral elements of the new architecture. Zumthor enveloped the ruins with a porous brick structure, its perforated façade filtering light and air while allowing the old masonry to remain visible. The material continuity between the old and the new, the handmade bricks, the muted tones, the tactile surfaces, produces a sense of quiet dialogue. Inside, visitors move between fragments of walls and contemporary volumes, between shadow and light, between what endures and what has been lost. The museum does not resolve history; it holds it open. Its beauty lies precisely in that tension; in the way fragility is given dignity without being disguised.

But long before Zumthor, Sverre Fehn articulated a similar approach in his Hedmark Museum . Built among the ruins of a medieval fortress, Fehn inserted a sequence of concrete and timber walkways that hover delicately above the archaeological remains. The intervention does not reconstruct what was lost, nor does it mimic the old masonry. Instead, it frames it, creating a space of encounter between epochs. Fehn's architecture of suspension anticipated many of the questions that contemporary architects continue to explore today: How can we build within what already exists without consuming it? How can the new give voice to the old? But long before Zumthor, Sverre Fehn articulated a similar approach in his Hedmark Museum .

The architects' decision to convert the Bankside Power Station into an art museum was not merely functional reuse, but an acknowledgement of the structure's latent character. The turbine hall, left largely intact, became both a public space and a spatial manifesto — a cathedral of industrial memory. By maintaining the monumental brick shell and reinterpreting it with new insertions, Herzog & de Meuron revealed how the traces of labor, soot, and steel could form the aesthetic foundation of contemporary culture. The later addition of the Switch House tower in 2016 extended this narrative, continuing the dialogue between utility and imagination. The power of the Tate Modern lies in its refusal to sanitize the past; it celebrates the endurance of material and the adaptability of form.

Together, these works demonstrate that the incomplete is not an error to be corrected but a condition to be understood. By refusing total restoration or aesthetic closure, they allow buildings to express the passage of time as part of their identity. The cracks, marks, and scars are not erased but inscribed into the experience of space. In the Kolumba, the fragments of a church become part of a contemporary museum; in the Tate Modern, an obsolete factory becomes a civic living room; in the Hedmark Museum, ruins become structure, and structure becomes memory. By embracing imperfection, architecture finds a new form of beauty, one that acknowledges the unfinished nature of every place and the shared responsibility of keeping it alive.

The Ethics of Non-Building Behind this aesthetic lies an ethical position. To choose not to build is to resist the economic systems that equate progress with development. It questions the assumption that architectural value is measured in square meters or in the spectacle of new form, challenging a profession long dependent on growth-based models. In an era when construction itself contributes significantly to global carbon emissions, this act of refusal becomes a statement that less can, in fact, sustain more.

The future of architecture may depend less on expansion than on the capacity to renew what already exists. Drawing on Jaime Lerner's belief that ""the future of architecture lies not in building new cities, but in updating those that already exist,"" Romullo Baratto in Back to the Future: Why Refurbishing Matters , written for ArchDaily's book , frames reuse as an act of intelligence; a form of progress grounded in continuity rather than rupture. Within this perspective, the work of architecture is not to add more, but to understand how the existing can be transformed, extended, and cared for.

Keller Easterling , in her essay Subtraction , argues that not building can constitute one of the most potent spatial interventions available today. For Easterling, subtraction is not simply the removal of matter but an active reconfiguration of existing conditions — a recalibration of the urban environment through editing rather than expansion. Demolition , abandonment, or vacancy, she notes, are not endpoints but phases that can be strategically managed to open new forms of occupation and value. By treating empty lots, residual infrastructures, or obsolete buildings as latent resources, architects can work within what she calls the space of the existing, turning stillness into opportunity. Subtraction, in this sense, is designed through intelligence rather than accumulation .

This idea resonates with Jonathan Hill's argument in Immaterial Architecture , where he expands the discipline beyond the physical object to include the invisible labor of use, adaptation, and maintenance. Hill insists that architecture does not end when construction stops; it continues through the acts that sustain it (cleaning, repairing, modifying, inhabiting). Every user becomes an architect, and every adjustment, however small, contributes to the life of the built environment. Both Easterling and Hill redefine design as an act of care and not a heroic gesture of form-making; a distributed process of stewardship that keeps the city alive. This is not about nostalgia or conservation, but about acknowledging interdependence between buildings and their users, between construction and ecology.

Building less ultimately calls for a reimagining of architectural agency. It challenges professionals to design not only structures but also infrastructures of care. It invites architects to see the existing city as a field of potential, where every wall, street, or fragment can be reactivated rather than replaced. The discipline's future may depend less on new monuments and more on invisible gestures. In this paradigm, design becomes a form of editing, an act of choosing what to keep, what to transform, and what to leave untouched. The measure of creativity lies not in expansion but in restraint, not in quantity but in consequence. To build less, in the end, is not to design less; it is to design with greater precision, responsibility, and imagination. Building less ultimately calls for a reimagining of architectural agency.

Snøhetta 's design introduces a cave-like ground floor inspired by the meandering path of the Rhine , envisioning a porous urban interface that encourages movement and public engagement. By dividing the overall massing into three asymmetrical trapezoidal volumes and integrating passageways at ground level, the scheme allows daylight to permeate the site and enhances circulation on a compact plot.

A biosolar roof integrates photovoltaic panels , skylights , and technical equipment, interspersed with terraced plantings featuring species native to the Lower Rhine floodplains. Together, the building's silhouette, openings, and landscaped terraces establish a cultural institution that is both contextually rooted and visually expressive.

Many early kits echoed the dominant styles of their own era, from the richly ornamented forms of the Wilhelminian period in the Anker stones to the futuristic, expressionistic massing implicitly referenced in the Ingenius kit of 1924, which anticipated the cinematic urban landscapes of Metropolis (1927). The curators also reflect on how these toys framed architectural play : instructions were often highly complex, demanding patience and perseverance, and rarely encouraged the free experimentation originally advocated by Friedrich Fröbel. Despite being marketed to children, many kits seemed geared toward serious, almost adult-like concentration, often casting boys as ""little builders"" while placing girls at the margins. To balance this, DAM has introduced uniform, IKEA-style instructions for all play stations, providing accessible guidance for contemporary audiences.

Among the special construction kits on display, the Architecto-Baukasten (Keller & Sohn, 1944) stands out for its monumental 3.2-meter felt cathedral, scaled up and assembled using over 4,000 components thanks to the support of insulation manufacturer Impact Acoustic. Another highlight is the American Skyline kit (Elgo Plastics Inc., 1950s–60s), which introduces a skeleton construction system unlike the solid-block logic typical of other sets, enabling surprisingly rapid assembly of early 20th-century U.S. skyscrapers. Also featured is the GDR-era Mentor kit Wir bauen auf!, a rare example tied to the short-lived phase of Socialist Classicism before state policy shifted toward industrialized prefabrication in 1954.

This is precisely where FabriTRAK Systems operates. The American company specializes in architectural solutions for acoustic control and interior design, and is internationally recognized for its modular stretched-fabric panel system. Founded in 1977, the company developed the first method that combined track profiles, acoustic infill, and fabric to create a visually appealing acoustic interior solution. The system allows the use of tensioned fabrics, felts, leathers, or vinyls, fixed into the track's serrated jaws to ensure a seamless finish. Depending on the project, different infill materials can be selected to absorb, diffuse, or control sound transmission according to the acoustic needs of each environment.

A distinct approach for every space For example, in places of worship , sound becomes part of spirituality itself, shaping both intimacy and transcendence. The challenge is to preserve the warmth and resonance that support music and liturgy while maintaining clarity for spoken word. In other words, the space must allow for both absorption and reverberation in delicate balance. FabriTRAK's site-built system fine-tunes acoustic performance to the proportions of the architecture, controlling the buildup of specific frequencies and ensuring an even distribution of sound energy. The result is an atmosphere where silence is not simply the absence of sound, but a presence that shapes perception and deepens devotion.

In museums and cultural centers , where acoustic systems are often integrated behind walls or ceilings, the goal is controlled neutrality to support the exhibited works without interfering with them. These environments host multimedia exhibitions, video art, and immersive installations that depend on precise sound diffusion. By optimizing reverberation time and minimizing unwanted reflections, FabriTRAK Systems solutions create clarity and calm, offering sonic transparency that allows visitors to fully immerse themselves in the sensory experience of art.

In recording studios , precision is paramount and silence is fundamental. Metrics such as the Sound Transmission Class (STC) and Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) become essential. FabriTRAK wall and ceiling systems that incorporate high-performance cores such as TerraCORE® Poly offer the flexibility needed to absorb targeted frequency ranges and control room modes. Manufactured from a special blend of very low-denier polyester fibers, the system delivers enhanced acoustic absorption and is available in standard or high densities.

In theaters and performance halls, adaptability is key. The same space must accommodate spoken plays, orchestral concerts, and amplified events. The combination of high NRC absorption and mid-frequency diffusion ensures uniform sound distribution, improves the Speech Transmission Index (STI), and reduces echoes and unwanted reflections. Discreetly integrated into walls, ceilings, or audience areas, FabriTRAK systems enhance clarity without compromising aesthetics, allowing sound to amplify the narrative rather than compete with it.

Instead of equating innovation with novelty, it invites architects to engage with what is already there; to read the city as a palimpsest of histories, resources, and social relations.

Related Article Deconstruct, Do Not Demolish: The Practice of Reuse of Materials in Architecture Building Less, Designing More For much of the twentieth century, modern architecture equated progress with construction. Cities became laboratories for growth , and demolition was seen as a necessary step toward renewal. The rhetoric of ""starting fresh"" shaped postwar reconstruction, industrial expansion, and late-modernist urban planning. Yet this logic — of erasing to rebuild — has come under increasing scrutiny. Demolition disperses the carbon already stored in structures and triggers new emissions through replacement materials; it also generates large volumes of waste that are difficult to reinsert into productive cycles. Beyond environmental impact, it breaks social continuities: tenants are displaced, everyday networks are interrupted, and the memory embedded in the city is lost.

In contrast, architects such as Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal have grounded their work in the principle ""never demolish, never remove, never replace"" . Instead of treating the existing as an obstacle, they approach it as a starting point. At the Grand Parc renewal in Bordeaux , they retained postwar housing blocks and worked with their structural rhythm to graft winter gardens and generous balconies onto the facades, improving thermal performance and expanding domestic space without evacuating residents. Interior layouts were reconfigured with light-touch operations, bringing daylight deeper into the plan and allowing flexible occupation over time.

Interior layouts were reconfigured with light-touch operations, bringing daylight deeper into the plan and allowing flexible occupation over time. This approach is consistent across other works by the studio. At the Tour Bois-le-Prêtre , developed with Frédéric Druot , the team refused demolition proposals and instead enlarged the building envelope with prefabricated extensions, creating new rooms, loggias, and winter gardens for each apartment while upgrading services and insulation. The reuse of the structural frame preserved the building's embodied resources and avoided the disruption of relocation. At the FRAC Nord–Pas de Calais , they maintained the vast hall of a former shipyard and added a simple, translucent volume alongside it, allowing the existing industrial space to remain active for exhibitions and public programs while the new volume provided controlled environmental conditions. But even when building from scratch, as in the School of Architecture in Nantes , the strategy is similar — designing a generous, open structure with intermediate spaces that can be occupied in multiple ways, minimizing fixed partitions and maximizing the capacity for future change, they run a consistent method: identify what works, reinforce the structure that holds value, and add only what is necessary to unlock new use.

A similar strategy can be found in the work of Rotor Deconstruction . Founded as a spin-off of the Brussels-based architecture collective Rotor , the initiative specializes in the careful dismantling and redistribution of building components. Rather than treating demolition as an endpoint, they view it as the beginning of a new material cycle. By cataloguing, cleaning, and reselling salvaged elements — from façade panels to door handles — Rotor creates a secondary market that challenges the linear logic of construction. Their operations are both logistical and cultural as they reveal the hidden labor embedded in materials and demonstrate that reuse can be systematic, not marginal. In doing so, they redefine what it means to design, shifting the architect's role from maker to mediator, from producer of new objects to curator of existing ones.

Taken together, these projects clarify why transformation has become a credible alternative to replacement. By keeping primary frames, foundations, and circulation cores, they shorten construction time, reduce material throughput, and preserve the social life of a place. What was once seen as a limitation — the constraint of an existing structure — becomes a source of invention. In this model, authorship shifts from imposition to calibration. The designer listens to the building's geometry, traces of occupation, and structural logic; the intervention emerges from those conditions rather than against them.

Design Through Absence Restraint does not mean passivity. It requires precision, judgment, and imagination, the ability to intervene only where necessary and to design with minimal means. Few projects embody this more eloquently than David Chipperfield's restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin . Restraint does not mean passivity. It requires precision, judgment, and imagination, the ability to intervene only where necessary and to design with minimal means. Few projects embody this more eloquently than David Chipperfield's restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin . He inherited a ruin. Severely damaged during World War II and left untouched for more than half a century, the building existed as both a cultural void and a monument to loss. Chipperfield's intervention, developed with conservation specialist Julian Harrap , did not aim to restore the museum to its pre-war appearance nor to disguise its destruction. Instead, it sought to stabilize and complete what remained, preserving the building's historical layers as tangible records of time. New elements — staircases, columns, and wall surfaces — were added only where structurally essential, using materials such as pale brick, concrete, and oak that quietly differentiate themselves from the original fabric. The new never imitates the old, and the old is never idealized; both coexist in a carefully balanced composition of absence and presence. He inherited a ruin.

This understanding of design as measured intervention also defines Sala Beckett , a project by Flores & Prats that transformed a decaying cooperative building into a theatre and cultural laboratory. Rather than stripping the structure back to a neutral shell, the architects preserved the residue of previous lives: faded frescoes, cracked tiles, remnants of stage sets. The new spatial organization unfolds around these traces, treating them as actors in the ongoing narrative of the building. Walls were patched rather than repainted, doors were adjusted instead of replaced, and new partitions were built as reversible frameworks. The building's imperfections were not concealed but illuminated, revealing how memory can coexist with use, and how fragility can become a form of strength — maximum effect through minimum action.

Both projects articulate a way of working defined not by addition, but by calibration. They resist the modernist impulse to erase and remake, replacing it with a patient search for continuity. Their power lies not in visual spectacle but in what remains unsaid — the voids, the silences, the unaltered walls that hold the weight of history. This economy of gesture transforms limitation into aesthetic intelligence. The less that is added, the more the existing fabric speaks. When seen together, these approaches reveal that absence can be as expressive as form. It is an architecture of patience and empathy, in which restraint becomes the medium through which meaning is constructed. In a time when excess has exhausted its possibilities, these practices show that doing less — and doing it well — may be the most radical act of all.

The Aesthetics of the Incomplete Restraint also redefines aesthetics. The architecture of the twentieth century often pursued completeness. In contrast, many contemporary works find expression in incompleteness, embracing the unfinished, the layered, and the imperfect. This sensibility acknowledges that buildings, like cities, are never static; they exist in continuous negotiation with time, decay, and use. Restraint also redefines aesthetics.

This sensibility acknowledges that buildings, like cities, are never static; they exist in continuous negotiation with time, decay, and use. Peter Zumthor's Kolumba Museum captures this idea with remarkable clarity. Built upon the ruins of a bombed Gothic church, the project preserves the remains not as relics to be protected behind glass, but as integral elements of the new architecture. Zumthor enveloped the ruins with a porous brick structure, its perforated façade filtering light and air while allowing the old masonry to remain visible. The material continuity between the old and the new, the handmade bricks, the muted tones, the tactile surfaces, produces a sense of quiet dialogue. Inside, visitors move between fragments of walls and contemporary volumes, between shadow and light, between what endures and what has been lost. The museum does not resolve history; it holds it open. Its beauty lies precisely in that tension; in the way fragility is given dignity without being disguised.

But long before Zumthor, Sverre Fehn articulated a similar approach in his Hedmark Museum . Built among the ruins of a medieval fortress, Fehn inserted a sequence of concrete and timber walkways that hover delicately above the archaeological remains. The intervention does not reconstruct what was lost, nor does it mimic the old masonry. Instead, it frames it, creating a space of encounter between epochs. Fehn's architecture of suspension anticipated many of the questions that contemporary architects continue to explore today: How can we build within what already exists without consuming it? How can the new give voice to the old? But long before Zumthor, Sverre Fehn articulated a similar approach in his Hedmark Museum .

The architects' decision to convert the Bankside Power Station into an art museum was not merely functional reuse, but an acknowledgement of the structure's latent character. The turbine hall, left largely intact, became both a public space and a spatial manifesto — a cathedral of industrial memory. By maintaining the monumental brick shell and reinterpreting it with new insertions, Herzog & de Meuron revealed how the traces of labor, soot, and steel could form the aesthetic foundation of contemporary culture. The later addition of the Switch House tower in 2016 extended this narrative, continuing the dialogue between utility and imagination. The power of the Tate Modern lies in its refusal to sanitize the past; it celebrates the endurance of material and the adaptability of form.

Together, these works demonstrate that the incomplete is not an error to be corrected but a condition to be understood. By refusing total restoration or aesthetic closure, they allow buildings to express the passage of time as part of their identity. The cracks, marks, and scars are not erased but inscribed into the experience of space. In the Kolumba, the fragments of a church become part of a contemporary museum; in the Tate Modern, an obsolete factory becomes a civic living room; in the Hedmark Museum, ruins become structure, and structure becomes memory. By embracing imperfection, architecture finds a new form of beauty, one that acknowledges the unfinished nature of every place and the shared responsibility of keeping it alive.

The Ethics of Non-Building Behind this aesthetic lies an ethical position. To choose not to build is to resist the economic systems that equate progress with development. It questions the assumption that architectural value is measured in square meters or in the spectacle of new form, challenging a profession long dependent on growth-based models. In an era when construction itself contributes significantly to global carbon emissions, this act of refusal becomes a statement that less can, in fact, sustain more.

The future of architecture may depend less on expansion than on the capacity to renew what already exists. Drawing on Jaime Lerner's belief that ""the future of architecture lies not in building new cities, but in updating those that already exist,"" Romullo Baratto in Back to the Future: Why Refurbishing Matters , written for ArchDaily's book , frames reuse as an act of intelligence; a form of progress grounded in continuity rather than rupture. Within this perspective, the work of architecture is not to add more, but to understand how the existing can be transformed, extended, and cared for.

Keller Easterling , in her essay Subtraction , argues that not building can constitute one of the most potent spatial interventions available today. For Easterling, subtraction is not simply the removal of matter but an active reconfiguration of existing conditions — a recalibration of the urban environment through editing rather than expansion. Demolition , abandonment, or vacancy, she notes, are not endpoints but phases that can be strategically managed to open new forms of occupation and value. By treating empty lots, residual infrastructures, or obsolete buildings as latent resources, architects can work within what she calls the space of the existing, turning stillness into opportunity. Subtraction, in this sense, is designed through intelligence rather than accumulation .

This idea resonates with Jonathan Hill's argument in Immaterial Architecture , where he expands the discipline beyond the physical object to include the invisible labor of use, adaptation, and maintenance. Hill insists that architecture does not end when construction stops; it continues through the acts that sustain it (cleaning, repairing, modifying, inhabiting). Every user becomes an architect, and every adjustment, however small, contributes to the life of the built environment. Both Easterling and Hill redefine design as an act of care and not a heroic gesture of form-making; a distributed process of stewardship that keeps the city alive. This is not about nostalgia or conservation, but about acknowledging interdependence between buildings and their users, between construction and ecology.

Building less ultimately calls for a reimagining of architectural agency. It challenges professionals to design not only structures but also infrastructures of care. It invites architects to see the existing city as a field of potential, where every wall, street, or fragment can be reactivated rather than replaced. The discipline's future may depend less on new monuments and more on invisible gestures. In this paradigm, design becomes a form of editing, an act of choosing what to keep, what to transform, and what to leave untouched. The measure of creativity lies not in expansion but in restraint, not in quantity but in consequence. To build less, in the end, is not to design less; it is to design with greater precision, responsibility, and imagination. Building less ultimately calls for a reimagining of architectural agency.

Snøhetta 's design introduces a cave-like ground floor inspired by the meandering path of the Rhine , envisioning a porous urban interface that encourages movement and public engagement. By dividing the overall massing into three asymmetrical trapezoidal volumes and integrating passageways at ground level, the scheme allows daylight to permeate the site and enhances circulation on a compact plot.

Inside, the material strategy continues the geological theme through mineral surfaces with subtle tonal variations. The main 1,300-seat auditorium features smoked oak paneling and red seating, recalling elements of the existing opera house, which is slated for demolition. A biosolar roof integrates photovoltaic panels , skylights , and technical equipment, interspersed with terraced plantings featuring species native to the Lower Rhine floodplains. Together, the building's silhouette, openings, and landscaped terraces establish a cultural institution that is both contextually rooted and visually expressive.

Many early kits echoed the dominant styles of their own era, from the richly ornamented forms of the Wilhelminian period in the Anker stones to the futuristic, expressionistic massing implicitly referenced in the Ingenius kit of 1924, which anticipated the cinematic urban landscapes of Metropolis (1927). The curators also reflect on how these toys framed architectural play : instructions were often highly complex, demanding patience and perseverance, and rarely encouraged the free experimentation originally advocated by Friedrich Fröbel. Despite being marketed to children, many kits seemed geared toward serious, almost adult-like concentration, often casting boys as ""little builders"" while placing girls at the margins. To balance this, DAM has introduced uniform, IKEA-style instructions for all play stations, providing accessible guidance for contemporary audiences.

Among the special construction kits on display, the Architecto-Baukasten (Keller & Sohn, 1944) stands out for its monumental 3.2-meter felt cathedral, scaled up and assembled using over 4,000 components thanks to the support of insulation manufacturer Impact Acoustic. Another highlight is the American Skyline kit (Elgo Plastics Inc., 1950s–60s), which introduces a skeleton construction system unlike the solid-block logic typical of other sets, enabling surprisingly rapid assembly of early 20th-century U.S. skyscrapers. Also featured is the GDR-era Mentor kit Wir bauen auf!, a rare example tied to the short-lived phase of Socialist Classicism before state policy shifted toward industrialized prefabrication in 1954.

This is precisely where FabriTRAK Systems operates. The American company specializes in architectural solutions for acoustic control and interior design, and is internationally recognized for its modular stretched-fabric panel system. Founded in 1977, the company developed the first method that combined track profiles, acoustic infill, and fabric to create a visually appealing acoustic interior solution. The system allows the use of tensioned fabrics, felts, leathers, or vinyls, fixed into the track's serrated jaws to ensure a seamless finish. Depending on the project, different infill materials can be selected to absorb, diffuse, or control sound transmission according to the acoustic needs of each environment.

A distinct approach for every space For example, in places of worship , sound becomes part of spirituality itself, shaping both intimacy and transcendence. The challenge is to preserve the warmth and resonance that support music and liturgy while maintaining clarity for spoken word. In other words, the space must allow for both absorption and reverberation in delicate balance. FabriTRAK's site-built system fine-tunes acoustic performance to the proportions of the architecture, controlling the buildup of specific frequencies and ensuring an even distribution of sound energy. The result is an atmosphere where silence is not simply the absence of sound, but a presence that shapes perception and deepens devotion.

In museums and cultural centers , where acoustic systems are often integrated behind walls or ceilings, the goal is controlled neutrality to support the exhibited works without interfering with them. These environments host multimedia exhibitions, video art, and immersive installations that depend on precise sound diffusion. By optimizing reverberation time and minimizing unwanted reflections, FabriTRAK Systems solutions create clarity and calm, offering sonic transparency that allows visitors to fully immerse themselves in the sensory experience of art.

In recording studios , precision is paramount and silence is fundamental. Metrics such as the Sound Transmission Class (STC) and Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) become essential. FabriTRAK wall and ceiling systems that incorporate high-performance cores such as TerraCORE® Poly offer the flexibility needed to absorb targeted frequency ranges and control room modes. Manufactured from a special blend of very low-denier polyester fibers, the system delivers enhanced acoustic absorption and is available in standard or high densities.

In theaters and performance halls, adaptability is key. The same space must accommodate spoken plays, orchestral concerts, and amplified events. The combination of high NRC absorption and mid-frequency diffusion ensures uniform sound distribution, improves the Speech Transmission Index (STI), and reduces echoes and unwanted reflections. Discreetly integrated into walls, ceilings, or audience areas, FabriTRAK systems enhance clarity without compromising aesthetics, allowing sound to amplify the narrative rather than compete with it.

The school is organized around two primary volumes that define a central courtyard with a playground , sports fields, and staff parking. The main teaching block faces the 19th-century train station with a cantilevered timber porch that guides students from the public realm into a protected environment. A cut-out in the roof preserves an existing tree, anchoring the building within its immediate context.

The brand said although the make up of the material has not been changed, it is now the ""world's first"" carbon-negative linoleum across the full product life cycle due to the creation of a closed loop system. Tarkett has announced that its linoleum is now carbon-negative across all stages of its life cycle It has now implemented a closed-loop system that has three key stages. First it manufactures linoleum using materials that absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, as well as 100 per cent recirculated industrial water and 100 per cent renewable electricity at its factory in Narni, Italy. Tarkett has been creating linoleum using the same recipe since 1898 – a mix of 97 per cent natural and renewable materials including cork, wood powder, pine rosin and linseed oil. The remaining three per cent is made up of colour pigments and surface protection. The brand collects post-consumer linoleum and returns it to the Tarkett factory in Italy Next, the brand installs the linoleum, ensuring that any scraps or offcuts are returned to Tarkett and used to make additional flooring. Finally, at the end of the material's expected 30-year lifespan, Tarkett collects post-consumer linoleum and returns it to the brand's factory in Narni, where it is broken down and used to make new flooring.

Tarkett linoleum is made from 97 per cent natural and renewable materials Leneveu said that Tarkett calculates and externally verifies its flooring's ""circular carbon footprint"" to keep track of the carbon it generates and saves. The vice president said that one of the key challenges is incentivising consumers to return flooring to Tarkett at the end of its life, while it is still ""so much cheaper and easier"" to send materials to landfill. ""Regulation can play a key role in helping to make circularity the default option,"" considered Leneveu, who encouraged manufacturers to work together to ensure that closed-loop systems are as accessible as possible.

49,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"Ixi introduces ""auto-focus glasses"" that switch from reading to long-distance prescriptions",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/18/auto-focus-glasses-ixi/,18 November 2025 – 17:00,"Finnish company Ixi has revealed what it describes as the world's first ""auto-focus glasses"", which change their optical power depending on where the wearer is looking. Set to be presented tomorrow at Helsinki tech event Slush, Ixi 's auto-focus glasses are a substitute for traditional multifocal or reading glasses with a prescription for near vision that is only activated when the wearer is looking at close objects. Instead of conventional lenses, the glasses feature ""tunable"" lenses, with liquid crystal technology that changes position as needed to adjust the direction of light as it heads towards the eye. Ixi has created the world's first ""auto-focus glasses"" The technology runs on low power, and in the working prototype Ixi is presenting at Slush , it has managed to pack it into a frame weighing just 22 grams – lighter than any pair of smart glasses on the market. The glasses are targeted at people with presbyopia, the far-sightedness that every one of us develops with age as the lens and surrounding eye muscle changes, making reading at close distances difficult. While bifocal, varifocal or progressive lenses are the established solution for existing glasses-wearers in this situation, Ixi founder and CEO Niko Eiden explained that they are far from ideal. Read: Meta launches first AI smart glasses with integrated display ""Usually people between 20 and 45 are quite happy with their glasses,"" Eiden said. ""But [with multifocal glasses] it's a blend of multiple lenses that they blend into one, which means that there is a lot of distortion, because there needs to be these transition zones, and those transition zones are usually full of aberrations, and they twist the world."" As a result, only a ""very narrow channel"" within the lens is actually usable and people will often tilt their heads in order to use the segment of the lens that accords to where they want to look. The glasses are targeted at people with far-sightedness Eiden, who had a background working on augmented-reality glasses, including co-founding the company Varjo , felt that tunable lenses combined with eye-tracking technology held a better solution. The lenses use liquid crystals – a well-established technology for displays best known for its use in old-fashioned calculators or digital watches. In those displays – which are famously low power, running for years on a single battery – a layer of liquid crystals is suspended in an electric field and the colour changes according to the position that those crystals are twisted into when adjusting the voltage. In the Ixi glasses, the same principle is at work, but the liquid crystals are sandwiched between a transparent lens rather than colour-producing filters. When deactivated, the crystals are flat, and when activated, they twist into a position that emulates the shape of a traditional convex lens, only at a thickness of 0.02 millimetres. The prototype weighs just 22 grams Activation happens automatically through the use of eye-tracking technology that recognises the subtle convergence that happens to focus on objects at a close distance. This is another area where Ixi has innovated, devising a tracking method using LEDs rather than the camera-based systems that feature in contemporary virtual-reality headsets and require a lot of computing power. The system is power efficient enough that the company has been able to fit all of the electronic components – including an all-day battery – into a plastic frame that is the same size as a conventional pair of glasses. ""We are for the first time now introducing a product that can actually use technology to help people to see better and actually have a more natural view of the world than with traditional eyewear,"" Eiden said. Read: Even Realities launches Even G2 smart glasses with camera-free AI functionality When it comes to style, the Ixi team's approach has been to start with classic frame shapes that chief design officer Timo Yliluoma described as ""modern and timeless at the same time"", and they plan to launch with one square and one round option. Instead of variety, they are prioritising customisability and ergonomics, with a system that they are calling TrueFit that allows customers to choose different nose pieces for different face shapes. The frames' angle and fit can further be adjusted by local opticians through standard heating and bending around the temples and tips, which are free of electronic components. Ixi intends to sell its product through existing opticians and announced in September that it had entered into a manufacturing partnership with Swiss lens-maker Optiswiss. The company's offering comes during a time when many new smart glasses are entering the market, almost all focused on expansive AI functionality.

50,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"Lidar and radar technology help to make EX90 ""the safest Volvo ever""",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/17/ex90-volvo/,17 November 2025 – 10:00,"Car company Volvo 's electric EX90 SUV has been shortlisted for a 2025 Dezeen Award for its innovative safety features, including sensors that can detect pedestrians up to 250 metres ahead. Volvo has already built its reputation around safety and the company's first fully electric seven-seater promises to be ""the safest Volvo ever"", with eight cameras, five radars, 16 ultrasonic sensors and a roof-mounted Lidar sensor. Volvo's EX90 has been shortlisted for a Dezeen Award ""The standard safety in the EX90 will be beyond that of any Volvo before it, offering one of the most advanced sensor systems on the market,"" the company said. EX90 's Lidar sensor uses a pulsed laser to generate precise, three-dimensional information about the surroundings and detect pedestrians at distances of up to 250 metres. A Lidar sensor is integrated into the car's roof The external sensors complement a driver understanding system that senses gaze patterns and steering behaviour, detecting if the driver is not paying attention to the road and providing assistance when needed. The vehicle also features a ""world-first"" interior radar system that is sensitive enough to detect movement at a submillimetre scale, such as a toddler's breathing. It can detect pedestrians at up to 250 metres away The technology, which covers the entire interior including the boot, is intended to prevent deaths that can occur if children or pets are left in a hot car. Volvo described the EX90 as a ""software-defined vehicle"" that is future-proofed and able to perform over-the-air updates so it automatically upgrades to the latest software version. Read: Electric car drivers are ""getting a better experience"" says Volvo chief designer This includes updates to the safe space technology as well as the in-car infotainment system, which is controlled using a 14.5-inch touchscreen centre display. A separate nine-inch driver display provides key information such as speed, battery and range. The EX90's exterior is distinctly electric, with a closed grille and flush design contributing to an aerodynamic form intended to reduce drag and increase efficiency. A nine-inch driver display provides key information such as speed and battery A minimalist cabin design informed by Volvo's Scandinavian heritage aims to create a light and spacious feel for passengers in each of the seven forward-facing seats. The internal palette replaces conventional automotive materials with sustainable alternatives, including FSC-certified wood and recycled plastic fabrics. The interior is covered by ""world-first"" radar system EX90 has been shortlisted in the consumer product design category of this year's Dezeen Awards, alongside self-assemblable headphones for children and a zero-waste disposable camera . Earlier this year, Volvo's chief designer Jeremy Offer told Dezeen that electric cars can provide a better experience for drivers by enhancing the technological interface and using premium materials. The company's ES90 electric vehicle , also launched in 2025, includes some of the same features as the EX90 in a form that combines aspects of a saloon car with the raised height and practicality of an SUV.

Created in an earthy colour palette, the virtual museum was created to raise awareness of the illicit trafficking of cultural property worldwide with items were sourced from a database by the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). Kéré, who hails from Burkina Faso and founded Berlin-based Kéré Architecture in 2005, aimed to designed the to convey the impact of lost heritage on communities with the UNESCO Virtual Museum of Stolen Cultural Objects . Diébédo Francis Kéré has designed a virtual museum with a spiralling gallery for UNESCO ""As an architect from a country that has been colonised, and whose artworks, treasures and historical artefacts were stolen, my goal is to make people aware of the importance of cultural heritage and the impact of its loss,"" Kéré told Dezeen. ""These objects are not just art to be displayed,"" said Kéré. ""In many cases, they have very practical functions, serve as tools of communication, or hold communities together in a spiritual way."" ""By raising awareness of this, we can understand how these losses affect all of us globally,"" he continued. ""Repatriation and restitution can deepen our understanding of different cultures."" Kéré contained the museum within a globe When entering the website, virtual visitors are first presented with a globe perched on a green hill. Inside the globe is an amphitheatre with a semicircular auditorium cut into the steps and a glowing archway that clicks through to the Return and Restitution Room, which features formerly lost objects that have been recovered. At the centre of the amphitheatre is a spiralling form that contains the Stolen Cultural Objects Gallery, designed as an abstract ramp that branches off into zones dedicated to different global regions. Read: Kéré Architecture unveils brick mausoleum for Burkina Faso's former president Visitors can scroll through clusters of stolen artefacts within the spiralling gallery or enter region-specific zones, which appear like rooms punctured with arched windows and circular skylights. ""In the galleries, many openings provide light,"" said Kéré. ""They represent the stolen objects that have left cracks in the regions and communities."" The design was based on the baobab tree and its roots Kéré drew upon trees and their unseen roots when designing the UNESCO Virtual Museum of Stolen Cultural Objects, intending to reflect the importance of art and artefacts to societies. ""The concept for the design of UNESCO's Virtual Museum is based on a tree, specifically the baobab tree, which is central to the lives of many African communities and serves as a symbol of resilience,"" he told Dezeen. ""A tree has roots, a trunk and a crown – we see the trunk and crown, while its roots remain hidden and provide stability and nourishment."" ""Cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, forms the essence of communities – these are the roots,"" Kéré continued. ""Removing these roots deprives communities of the foundation for growth, well-being and happiness."" Read: ""The idea of designing for virtual worlds is just getting started"" Although virtual design offered greater creative freedom compared to physical architecture, Kéré said his main intention was to create a simple design that would engage visitors. ""The main challenge in designing a virtual museum is deciding what to leave out, because the possibilities are endless,"" he said. ""I wanted the design to be relatable and grounded in our experience – simple in form and symbolic, using the tree and the globe,"" Kéré continued. ""The goal was to create something that people can connect with."" Other recent projects by the Kéré, who won the Pritzker Prize in 2022 , include a brick mausoleum in Burkina Faso and plans for a timber museum in Germany . The images are by Kéré Architecture.

53,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Even Realities launches Even G2 smart glasses with camera-free AI functionality,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/12/even-realities-g2-smart-glasses-with-camera-free-ai-functionality/,12 November 2025 – 15:23,"Chinese company Even Realities has launched its latest AI smart glasses , the Even G2s, offering advanced functionality such as real-time conversation enhancement while avoiding the controversial technology of an outward-facing camera. The Even G2 Display smart glasses are an upgrade of last year's Even G1s, with refined features including a teleprompter for public speaking, real-time translation, navigation and message notifications. They also added a new mode called Conversate, which is meant to improve discussions by popping up with contextually relevant information. This includes explaining terminology and providing background information, but can also extend to generating on-the-spot follow-up questions, captions and summaries. The Even G2 glasses feature an augmented-reality display with AI functionality All of this is conveyed on a minimal augmented-reality display, with neon green text reminiscent of an old-fashioned computer terminal, and controllable through touch via a new smart ring, the R1. Even Realities is targeting high-powered individuals in fields such as business and politics with the glasses, which are designed to be lightweight and stylish with screwless hinges and an elevated frame made from titanium and magnesium alloy. The glasses support prescriptions, including high diopter values of -12 to +12, and come in two styles and three muted colours – grey, brown or green. The glasses are designed with a focus on comfort and style ""We know people treat their face seriously,"" Even Realities founder and CEO Will Wang told Dezeen. ""The glasses that I wear, they need to have good fashion, a good frame, good construction, good ergonomics and also to support a good lens."" ""To make a pair of smart glasses, you should also keep those same elements there,"" he added. The smart glasses are partly notable for what they leave out: a front-facing camera of the kind central to the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses , launched earlier this year. There are two styles available and prescriptions are supported These use the camera to take photos and videos and also to employ AI computer vision to recognise objects in the wearer's field of view. For Wang, a former Apple engineer who worked on the Apple Watch, ""not everything that's possible is necessary"". He believes that given current social mores, the camera will be a barrier to adoption, potentially bringing wearers into conflict with people or venues that want to protect their privacy. That could stop wearers from leaving their glasses on all day, as they would with their regular prescription pair, which is the priority for Wang. The lightweight design is made from titanium and magnesium alloy ""I think people will probably accept it as time goes by and more regulation is in place where people feel more safe,"" he said. ""And companies are generally getting more responsible with data, but I think we're just not there yet."" He indicated that in the future, Even Realities might make the camera an accessory that users could snap onto the frame and then remove when they are done recording. The company's approach to cameras is in keeping with its philosophy of ""quiet tech"", which it says is about creating ""human-centric, design-first technology that blends into daily life"". Read: Is this the twilight of the smartphone? That means features shouldn't demand attention or distract the wearer the way that smartphones do – a proclamation that has become common among technology companies looking to develop a new generation of AI-centric devices . The Even G2 glasses work by shining micro-LED projectors into specially engineered lenses. These contain diffractive waveguides, a kind of nano-scale surface treatment that precisely directs light, effectively fanning out the tiny projected image into a crisp augmented-reality display. External viewers are not able to see the image, and the Even G2s look much like a pair of regular spectacles apart from a slight reflective difference in the waveguide area of the lenses. A micro-LED projector sits within the frame The Even R1 ring, also launching today, brings in health monitoring features as well as a touchpad that allows users to control their glasses through subtle swipes and taps. Both products connect to the user's smartphone, creating a connected ecosystem. Even Realities is selling the G2 and R1 in Europe and the US, and says it will launch in its home country later down the line. More than ten years after Google pulled Google Glass from sale, technology companies appear to be betting on smart glasses as a wearable device that will gain widespread adoption in the AI era. In addition to the high-profile launch of Meta's Ray-Ban Display , there are reports that Apple, Samsung and Google all have products in development.

54,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"Nothing launches Ear (3) headphones with ""Super Mic"" for calls",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/12/nothing-ear-3-headphones/,12 November 2025 – 05:00,"Promotion: eight different microphones, bone-conducting technology, and AI-powered noise cancellation come together in the latest wireless headphones by tech company Nothing . Released alongside the company's Nothing Phone (3) in September, the earbuds were designed to offer improved audio quality for calls and voice notes, while an upgraded 12-millimetre dynamic driver ensures cleaner sound. Nothing has released its Ear (3) earbuds Ear (3) promises to ""redefine in-ear audio"", combining Nothing 's signature transparent aesthetic with sleek metal detailing. ""We took everything we've learned so far about sound, design, and the touches that matter to people, and distilled it into a pair of category-defying buds that are mightier and even more striking than before,"" the company said. The earbuds come in black and white colourways A key feature that distinguishes the earbuds from their predecessors is the ""Super Mic"" integrated into the charging case for making calls or voice notes in a noisy environment. Users can bring the case up to their mouth like an external microphone and activate it using the ""talk"" button. Integrated ambient filtering technology cuts through the surrounding noise of up to 95 decibels – equivalent to a jackhammer going off 15 metres away. The Ear (3) charging case contains a Super Mic for calls and voice recordings The two microphones housed in the case add to the three directional microphones in each bud, for a grand total of eight. A bone-conduction Voice Pick-up Unit inside the headphones further enhances call clarity by detecting micro-vibrations from the jaw and ear canal, and converting them into electrical signals for precise voice pickup. ""Because bone-conducted signals are far less affected by wind and environmental noise, the system is better at differentiating between your speech and all other noise, keeping your voice clear at the source,"" Nothing explained. Combined with an AI-powered environmental noise-cancellation system, which adjusts to the user's surroundings every 600 milliseconds, this allows the earbuds to achieve wind noise reduction levels of over 45 decibels – even without the Super Mic. An upgraded 12 millimetre dynamic driver provides rich, natural sound thanks to its patterned surface, while a 20 per cent larger radiating area ensures better bass and treble response. There's also a low-latency mode that reduces end-to-end delay to under 120 milliseconds, keeping audio and visuals in sync when gaming or watching videos. Metal accents introduce a new design language for Nothing Each bud houses a 55 milliampere-hour battery for up to 10 hours of listening without the wireless charging case and 38 hours with it. For emergencies, a rapid USB-C charge can provide up to 10 hours of playback in just 10 minutes. For Nothing Phone users, any voice notes recorded using the ""talk"" button will automatically be transcribed, and the headphones can also be used to speak directly to ChatGPT . The earbuds were released in September Ear (3) marks the first time that Nothing is integrating metal into its product language, with recycled aluminium detailing found in both the earbuds and the case. ""Nano injection moulding fuses metal and plastic, removing the need for glue and achieving tight tolerances for a seamless, compact unibody,"" the company said.

55,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Design Museum pushes for stone construction in the UK with Stone Demonstrator,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/11/design-museum-stone-demonstrator-architecture/,11 November 2025 – 11:15,"Stone makes up the facade, frame, foundations and floor slabs in the Stone Demonstrator, a project by London's Design Museum aimed at getting the British construction industry to embrace the ""ultra-low-carbon"" material. A traditional but these days sometimes overlooked structural material, stone is given centre stage in the Stone Demonstrator , a 1:1 scale prototype of a section of a small housing block erected at Empress Place within West London's Earls Court development. Granite and limestone displaces all of the concrete and fired clay brick and nearly all of the steel that would normally be used in this everyday style of building, reducing the carbon emissions by around 90 per cent. The Stone Demonstrator showcases structural elements made of stone The project is the work of the Design Museum's Future Observatory – a research programme dedicated to catalysing the green transition – along with architects Groupwork and engineers Webb Yates and Arup , who regularly use structural stone. Groupwork founder and chairman Amin Taha said that the demonstrator was intended to show the local construction industry how straightforward it is to build with stone, using existing products and working to standard codes. ""Its purpose is not to promote stone for sentimental reasons but as an ultra-low-carbon alternative to reinforced concrete and steel structures clad in fired clay bricks,"" said Taha. The elements include a pre-tensioned stone frame suitable for buildings up to 80 storeys ""At 90 per cent less embodied carbon as concrete and steel frames and fired clay bricks, it's the ethical choice,"" he continued. The Stone Demonstrator's stone components start with the foundations, which were made of simple reused stone blocks from a decommissioned bank in the city that were used in a manner similar to the footings of historic buildings. Above that, there is a frame designed by Webb Yates and Arup . This was made using a newer approach to stone construction, with stone blocks that are pre-tensioned into beams and columns and then dropped into place on site. There are two hybrid stone floor slabs With this method, steel tendons are passed through the cavities in the stone and compressed by steel plates to make secure building elements that also have the benefit of being disassemblable and reusable in the future. This type of frame is not strictly necessary for a structure of three storeys, but Taha and Webb Yates associate director Liam Bryant indicated that it could be used in place of the reinforced concrete or steel frames in buildings of up to 80 storeys. For flooring, the Stone Demonstrator offers two slab options: one is another pre-tensioned stone solution – much like the frame but in a different shape – and the other is a new hybrid timber and stone product. The bricks are cut from raw stone Invented by Webb Yates and now in production by German company Bamberger , it involves stone slabs fixed on top of dowel-laminated timber (DLT). All of these components replace concrete, which Future Observatory director Justin McGuirk said he has come to think of as ""the ultra-processed food of the construction industry"" – a modern convenience but one that did not improve on the raw option. Read: Ten contemporary buildings that showcase the versatility of structural stone ""Concrete is stone that you dug up, crushed, burned, mixed with other stone, dredged sand from probably under the sea, mixed with water and chucked in the back of a lorry that has to spin at a regular rate,"" added Bryant. ""Stone construction is the same material. You dig it out of the ground, you cut it into pieces, you maybe put some rebar in it,"" he continued. ""It's one-third of the process."" The project is intended to push the UK construction industry towards building with stone In addition to targeting steel and concrete, the Stone Demonstrator takes aim at fired clay bricks, the London vernacular for exterior walls, with a self-supporting facade of bricks cut from raw stone. While clay bricks are rarely given the same amount of scrutiny in terms of sustainability, the stone bricks are again 90 per cent lower in carbon emissions, the Stone Demonstrator team said – a huge potential saving given that as many as 2.5 billion bricks are used in the UK annually . In total, the Stone Demonstrator team's calculations show that an equivalent structure built using a steel frame with a clay brick facade would emit around 40,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide, while one with a frame made of reinforced concrete would emit 32,000 kilograms. By contrast, the Stone Demonstrator produced 3,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide. The Stone Demonstrator emitted 90% less carbon than an equivalent structure made with steel, concrete and fired bricks Dezeen took an in-depth look at stone as a potential low-carbon, modern structural material in the Stone 2.0 content series in 2024. While many experts spoke in favour of the material , architect and researcher Natalia Petkova emphasised that it must be properly selected, sourced and transported . The photography is by Bas Princen. The Stone Demonstrator is expected to remain at Empress Place until at least June 2026 .

56,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Eight lights that will change the way you see 3D-printed design,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/07/3d-printed-lighting-design/,07 November 2025 – 11:15,"Could a 3D-printed lamp become a design classic? We look at some recent examples of how this technology can produce timeless objects, not just throwaway products. With so many 3D-printed products now on the market – typically manufactured in plastic – these pieces are often seen as cheap and disposable. Now, designers are out to prove that additive manufacturing can produce objects with long-term value, with qualities that aren't possible through other forms of production. This is most apparent in lighting design , where 3D-printed plastics or bioplastics can offer surprising mixes of form and translucence. ""When it comes to visual effects and transparency, the geometries and forms enabled by 3D printing are difficult to achieve with other transparent materials,"" said French designer Lucas Zito . ""Plastic will never be marble, oak, metal or glass, but it allows us to explore everything that lies beyond those categories."" ""The narrative creates emotional resonance"" Zito, who specialises in 3D-printed lighting, believes the key to making additively manufactured designs that people actually want to keep is by triggering emotion or memory. ""The essence of durability lies as much within the user as in the object itself,"" he told Dezeen. ""The narrative behind an object, whether spoken or unspoken, is what creates emotional resonance."" ""A plastic lamp will last as long as any other, as long as the user still wishes to keep it."" Some designers are exploring a softer side of 3D printing, using the technology to create designs that are evocative of paper or textiles, but inherently more durable. Read: US lighting brands ""not going back to 20th-century manufacturing"" Others are eschewing complex geometries, a common trend in 3D printing, and instead reinterpreting timeless forms. Norwegian designer Daniel Rybakken adopted both approaches in his latest design, a translucent version of a classic table lamp. He hopes to show that complexity is not always the best approach in 3D printing. ""Since the first 3D-printed objects started selling over 20 years ago, the main trend has been in adding complexity to the geometry,"" he said. ""I wanted to design something that felt both familiar and unique, giving a hint of a more complex substructure without falling into the enduring trend of overly intricate design."" Here's a look at eight lighting designs that suggest a bright future for 3D printing: Daniel Rybakken's Stillas is translucent version of archetypal table lamp Sweden-based Rybakken designed Stillas for Czech 3D printer company Prusa Research , based on the form of a classic table lamp and shade. It features a PLA plastic body so thin that the slender ""scaffolding"" frame is visible through the material. Lukas Zito's Buoy Lamps are a series of fluted totems Paris-based Zito has launched an array of striking 3D-printed lamps over the past four years. The Buoy lamps have become his signature. Available in vertical and horizontal configurations, these fluted PLA lamps are designed to resemble buoys bobbing around in the sea. Raw Edges turns 2D mesh into ethereal sculptures with LightMass^ Yael Mer and Shay Alkalay of London studio Raw Edges have launched their own lighting brand, LightMass^ , offering lightweight mesh pendants that are lit from within. Made from a PLA and biopolymer​ blend, their designs are printed in 2D, then folded and clipped together, creating 3D shapes that look like line drawings suspended in space. LightMass^ is shortlisted in the lighting category for Dezeen Awards 2025. Crème Atelier draws on ice cream with Soft Serve lamps Stockholm-based Crème Atelier was inspired by the swirling forms of ice cream with its sorbet-coloured Soft Serve lamps , which featured on Dezeen in 2023 and were nominated for Dezeen Awards the same year. The designers have since expanded the range, introducing both extra-large and portable versions. Pascal lamp by 91-92 looks like an inflatable Copenhagen studio 91-92 used 3D modelling tools to develop the soft, squishy form of the Pascal lampshade, which is printed from flexible TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) plastic. As Dezeen's Jennifer Hahn pointed out , the result ""looks vaguely like the blow-up armbands that kids wear for swimming"", even though it's not actually inflated. ObjetFormt's STL Series lamps take cues from paper boxes With their matt PLA surfaces, the STL Series lamps were designed by Dutch studio ObjetFormt to look like ubiquitous cardboard storage boxes. The paper-like surfaces are embossed with an edition number, encouraging you to think of them as valuable art objects rather than anonymous containers. Sheyn creates delicate fabric-like creases in Fald Pendant The pleated garments of fashion designer Issey Miyake are resonant in the fluid forms of this droplet-shaped pendant lamp. Designed by Nicolas Gold, co-founder of Vienna-based studio and brand Sheyn , the PLA Fald pendant is intended to evoke a sense of subtle rippling. Squish Totem by Emmanuel Hugnot puts a spin on the hourglass French designer Emmanuel Hugnot has developed a technique for shaping 3D-printed objects, using woven-like surfaces that bend like textiles when heated. The Squish Totem is a floor lamp formed of stacked modules, with the bends allowing for double curvatures.

57,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Gaming-inspired Parkinson's keyboard wins 2025 James Dyson Award,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/11/06/james-dyson-award-2025-global-winners/,06 November 2025 – 11:20,"A therapeutic keyboard for people with Parkinson's and an AI-powered water quality sensor have won this year's James Dyson Award , recognising the best inventions by students and graduates from across the world. Out of more than 2,100 entries from 28 countries, engineer Filip Budny's floating WaterSense buoy was selected as the global sustainability winner, while the OnCue keypad by product designer Alessandra Galli took home gold in the medical category. Alessandra Galli is among two winners of the 2025 James Dyson Award Each will receive a prize of £30,000 to help develop their prototype into a sellable, scalable product that can be brought to market. This year marks the first time that both winning projects integrate artificial intelligence (AI) in some way to analyse data and offer predictions. Her OnCue keyboard was designed for people with Parkinson's The OnCue keyboard uses AI as one of a series of therapeutic cues to help people with Parkinson's type more easily and accurately by managing the tremors and freezing that come with the neurological condition. Vibrations transmitted through the keys and matching wristbands help to guide the user's typing rhythm, while the AI functions much like predictive text, anticipating and illuminating the letter they are most likely to press next. Galli, who is a graduate of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, took cues from gaming keyboards to create a compact, split design that reduces strain on the hands and arms, with raised edges on the keycaps providing better purchase. The keys provide visual and haptic cues for easier and more accurate typing Sliders allow users to customise the haptic and visual cues to suit their specific symptoms, which can vary from person to person and day to day. Galli hopes to use the prize money to get the keyboard into the hands of people with Parkinson's and expand its use to support other neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's and dystonia. ""It's a clever and empowering solution, allowing people with Parkinson's and other motor conditions to stay connected and communicate independently,"" praised British inventor James Dyson, who launched the award in 2005. Read: Urify is a toilet-cleaning tablet that helps diagnose kidney disease In WaterSense, AI is used instead to provide real-time monitoring of the water quality in our rivers and lakes – and forecast pollution events up to 72 hours in advance. The device uses low-cost recyclable paper sensors to measure more than 20 key indicators of water quality, which are automatically replaced each day, much like a roll of film in a camera. The data gleaned in this process is transmitted to an AI-powered online platform at regular intervals, for example every minute or every hour. Filip Budny took home the top sustainability prize for his WaterSense buoy All of this information is made publicly available through a website and used to predict future pollution events, empowering local communities and authorities to take action to protect their waterways. Budny, a PhD candidate in nanotechnology at Poland's Warsaw University of Technology, designed the system to be powered by natural water currents through a built-in hydrogenerator. And the roll of paper sensors needs to be replaced only once a year, allowing for continuous monitoring. This is crucial because these landlocked bodies of water are especially vulnerable to pollution but much less closely watched than our seas. The device uses AI to provide real-time water quality monitoring ""Existing water quality monitoring systems are slow, manual and sporadic,"" Dyson said. ""Filip, our sustainability winner, has invented WaterSense to measure water quality in real time and smartly predict pollution before it happens."" Budny is already testing WaterSense in 20 locations across Poland in partnership with water companies and local governments. Now, the aim is to use his prize money to scale the system into a ""continent-wide network"" by 2026. Now in its 20th year, the James Dyson Award has supported more than 400 young inventors and awarded over a million pounds in prize money. Previous recipients include an anti-hair loss helmet for chemo patients , solar panels made from food waste and a hands-free IV for disaster zones .

""It's a clever and empowering solution, allowing people with Parkinson's and other motor conditions to stay connected and communicate independently,"" praised British inventor James Dyson, who launched the award in 2005. In WaterSense, AI is used instead to provide real-time monitoring of the water quality in our rivers and lakes – and forecast pollution events up to 72 hours in advance. The device uses low-cost recyclable paper sensors to measure more than 20 key indicators of water quality, which are automatically replaced each day, much like a roll of film in a camera. The data gleaned in this process is transmitted to an AI-powered online platform at regular intervals, for example every minute or every hour. All of this information is made publicly available through a website and used to predict future pollution events, empowering local communities and authorities to take action to protect their waterways. Budny, a PhD candidate in nanotechnology at Poland's Warsaw University of Technology, designed the system to be powered by natural water currents through a built-in hydrogenerator. And the roll of paper sensors needs to be replaced only once a year, allowing for continuous monitoring. This is crucial because these landlocked bodies of water are especially vulnerable to pollution but much less closely watched than our seas. ""Existing water quality monitoring systems are slow, manual and sporadic,"" Dyson said. ""Filip, our sustainability winner, has invented WaterSense to measure water quality in real time and smartly predict pollution before it happens."" Budny is already testing WaterSense in 20 locations across Poland in partnership with water companies and local governments. Now, the aim is to use his prize money to scale the system into a ""continent-wide network"" by 2026. Now in its 20th year, the James Dyson Award has supported more than 400 young inventors and awarded over a million pounds in prize money. Previous recipients include an anti-hair loss helmet for chemo patients , solar panels made from food waste and a hands-free IV for disaster zones .

58,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"AI questions ""what other qualities we have as designers"" say Front founders",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/31/front-sofia-lagerkvist-anna-lindgren-ai-interview/,31 October 2025 – 10:30,"Front 's Sofia Lagerkvist and Anna Lindgren are exploring whether AI could replace the designer. In this interview , the Swedish duo explain how curiosity helps them stay ahead of the curve. Since founding Front in 2004, Lagerkvist and Lindgren have been at the vanguard of many technologies shaping the future of the design industry, from 3D printing to virtual worlds . Now, they are digging deep into artificial intelligence (AI). They believe it's essential for any designer working today to understand the implications of this technology. ""It's not something you can ignore as a designer,"" said Lindgren. ""We need to know what it can do and how we can use it."" Above: with the project AI: Brilliantly Bad , Front tested AI's abilities as a designer. Photo by Andy Liffner . Top: Anna Lindgren (left) and Sofia Lagerkvist (right) founded Front in 2004. Photo by Pierre Bjork ""Designers see creativity as their superpower,"" added Lagerkvist, who is also a Dezeen Awards 2025 judge . ""AI is mimicking that process so well, so we need to look at what other qualities we have as designers, beyond making form,"" she told Dezeen. ""We need to understand how we interpret qualities beyond shape and function."" The first phase of this research project saw Front test AI's abilities as a designer by training a generative AI program to translate sketch drawings into three-dimensional objects . The duo trained a generative AI program to translate their sketches into 3D objects The duo are now investigating AI's capacity for abstract thought, based on its ability to mimic emotions and cultural understanding. This will be key to understanding the role of the designer in the future, argues Lagerkvist. ""We have so much more understanding of the world; that's what makes the human mind so different from AI,"" she said. ""We need to better understand what makes us good at creating objects that people connect with."" Front was an early adopter of motion-capture technology and 3D printing with the 2005 project Sketch Many of Front's projects are born out of self-initiated research. If Lagerkvist and Lindgren find something that interests them – an idea, process or technology – they dedicate time to exploring it, with no idea where it will lead. ""We have this ongoing dialogue,"" said Lindgren. ""We're always sending each other interesting things we find, particularly things we feel will have an impact on the future of design."" Outcomes from the research are varied, ranging from one-off objects and installations to commercial products, but the process almost always yields something unexpected. These two technologies allowed the designers to produce a series of furniture through the motion of drawing in 3D space One of their first collaborations stemmed from an interest in motion-capture technology and 3D printing, two techniques that were unfamiliar to the design world at that time. This led to Sketch (2005), a series of furniture produced through the motion of drawing in 3D space. A more recent example is Design By Nature (2020), which stemmed from a curiosity about how nature impacts human health and wellbeing, through what is now more commonly known as biophilia . In Design By Nature, Lagerkvist and Lindgren used 3D-scanning to help them replicate forms and textures found in nature Lagerkvist and Lindgren began by 3D-scanning forms and textures found in nature, then translated them into objects and textiles. This led to furniture for Moroso , fabrics for Kvadrat , carpets for Moooi and installations for Acne Studios . With the rise of AI, Front's approach offers clues about how designers can continue to offer value, developing ideas through open-ended exploration rather than simply responding to a question or brief. ""It allows us to find new knowledge and do things we would never do otherwise,"" said Lindgren. ""A project can be quite dry if the starting point is a brief to make a sofa system,"" added Lagerkvist. ""Exploring the idea of sitting in nature led to a sofa system with all these other qualities."" The project led to various brand collaborations, including a recent installation for fashion label Acne Studios. Photo by Andy Liffner Lagerkvist and Lindgren say curiosity is one of the most important aspects of their practice. This curiosity often leads to collaborations with experts in other fields, from scientists to manufacturers, and helps to explain why the pair are so good at anticipating future design trends. ""At the core of our interest is this question of how we can expand the toolbox of the designer,"" said Lagerkvist. ""A lot of the things we have made are the result of our curiosity about the design process,"" she added. ""We want to create objects that tell us more about the qualities within objects and how we relate to them."" Read: Front designs seven reflective objects to reveal the 8,000-year history of the mirror A telling example is Representation of Things (2005), a project born out of an interest in digital worlds. It saw Lagerkvist and Lindgren learn computer programming and develop their own video game. ""We could give objects qualities that they cannot have in the real world. We could design things without gravity or things that change when you touch them,"" explained Lagerkvist. ""Nobody understood what we were doing, but we thought it was interesting that these objects only existed in the game."" Front created their own video game with the 2005 project, Representation of Things The project was a far-sighted pre-figuring of ideas that have since become embedded in the public consciousness through virtual reality, NFTs and the metaverse . It remains to be seen whether their experiments with AI will be equally prescient. ""AI is constantly developing at such a speed, so it really is an ongoing process,"" said Lagerkvist. Nevertheless, Lagerkvist and Lindgren feel strongly that designers need to take a more active role in the evolution of AI, to ensure it works for rather than against them. ""AI can really be daunting, but I think it benefits us all to understand how it's developing,"" said Lagerkvist. ""We designers should certainly be part of that development.""

60,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"Nike developing ""second set of calf muscles"" with motor-assisted running device",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/27/nike-project-amplify-footwear-system-running-walking/,27 October 2025 – 17:09,"Nike has released early concept designs of its battery-powered Project Amplify anklet that adheres to a person's lower leg to give them a motorised ""boost"" while running or walking. Project Amplify was designed by Nike in collaboration with robotics company Dephy so that everyday athletes can walk or run more often, faster and with more ease, according to the brand. Nike has released an early design of a motorised ""footwear system"" that helps casual athletes run and walk faster ""The first-generation product isn't designed for competitive, faster runners trying to shave seconds off their time; rather, it's intended to serve athletes who want to go faster and farther with less effort by giving them more power for everyday movement – in effect, a second set of calf muscles,"" said the brand. The Project Amplify ""footwear system"" consists of a motorised anklet that extends upwards from the heel of a shoe, curves around the shin and ends in a rechargeable battery pack that wraps around the bottom of a calf. Its ""lightweight, powerful motor"" is located within the flat, pill-shaped disk that sits against the upper ankle, while a drive belt is also concealed within the system. The system lifts the wearer's heel to help them step or walk, and it's designed to match a natural stride. The brand has created a number of different versions during testing phases The brand likened the motorised movement to the boost from an electric bicycle. It is designed, in particular, for athletes who run between a 10- and 12-minute mile pace. Nike also said this current iteration is the result of ""several years"" of testing in outdoor environments and at the Nike Sport Research Lab research complex in Beaverton, Oregon, with more than 400 athletes donning over nine different versions of the ankelet over the past years. Read: Lego and Nike add modular sports playground to Shanghai primary school According to the brand, in some cases, it helped 12-minute mile runners shave off two minutes from their time. While it's unclear if Nike plans to develop a specific shoe with each iteration of Project Amplify, for now, the system attaches to a carbon fibre-plated running shoe that can be worn with or without it. The brand is still in its testing phase with the project, although it plans to launch a consumer version in the ""coming years"". Nike plans to release a consumer version in the ""coming years"" ""Project Amplify started with a single question: 'What if we could find a way to help athletes move faster and farther with less energy and a lot more fun?',"" said Nike Director of footwear innovation Michael Donaghu. ""At its core, Project Amplify is about seamlessly adding a little more power to your stride."" Last year, Nike unveiled that it is developing an AI model informed by its athlete data , while more recently, the brand collaborated with Lego on a modular playground for a Shanghai primary school .

The system lifts the wearer's heel to help them step or walk, and it's designed to match a natural stride. The brand likened the motorised movement to the boost from an electric bicycle. It is designed, in particular, for athletes who run between a 10- and 12-minute mile pace. Nike also said this current iteration is the result of ""several years"" of testing in outdoor environments and at the Nike Sport Research Lab research complex in Beaverton, Oregon, with more than 400 athletes donning over nine different versions of the ankelet over the past years. According to the brand, in some cases, it helped 12-minute mile runners shave off two minutes from their time. While it's unclear if Nike plans to develop a specific shoe with each iteration of Project Amplify, for now, the system attaches to a carbon fibre-plated running shoe that can be worn with or without it. The brand is still in its testing phase with the project, although it plans to launch a consumer version in the ""coming years"". ""Project Amplify started with a single question: 'What if we could find a way to help athletes move faster and farther with less energy and a lot more fun?',"" said Nike Director of footwear innovation Michael Donaghu. ""At its core, Project Amplify is about seamlessly adding a little more power to your stride."" Last year, Nike unveiled that it is developing an AI model informed by its athlete data , while more recently, the brand collaborated with Lego on a modular playground for a Shanghai primary school .

61,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Designers most likely among creatives to believe AI dulls creativity,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/27/ai-dulls-creativity-design-survey/,27 October 2025 – 10:30,"Designers have emerged as the group most sceptical towards artificial intelligence in an attitudes survey of UK creative professionals, with four in five saying that the technology undermines originality. Eighty-one per cent of designers said that they believed AI dulled creativity, compared to 63 per cent of writers and journalists, according to the survey by research centre DIGIT Lab , which is part of the University of Exeter. The sentiment was echoed across the creative industries, where a total of 78 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement: ""Do you think AI generated creative work often feels homogenised and less likely to connect with audiences than work created by humans?"" ""Only humans can be creative beyond what is known"" DIGIT Lab's survey was conducted with 500 creative professionals across industries, including art and photography, advertising and branding, and media and entertainment. It shows widespread concern about how artificial intelligence is transforming creative work, the research lab said, with costs to human workers' satisfaction and self-belief. Read: Copyright exemption plans for AI are ""nothing less than vandalism"" say UK architects and designers ""True creativity needs nourishment, not substitution,"" said DIGIT Lab director Saeema Ahmed-Kristensen, urging industries to ""position AI as a tool for creation, not as a replacement for creativity itself"". ""Large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini can generate ideas at speed, remix ideas and surface countless options, but they cannot experience imagination, inspiration or intention – the qualities that give creative work meaning and resonance,"" she said. ""Only humans can be creative beyond what is known."" Seventy per cent of creatives concerned about job losses The survey also looked at the uptake of AI in the creative industries, finding that 94 per cent of respondents said they now use AI in some part of their process – although the figure is substantially lower among designers at only 52 per cent. Honing in on Gen Z, it found that two-thirds of creatives in this generation use AI tools, but just one in 10 believes that machine-made work holds genuine creative value. Seventy per cent of all creatives are concerned about job losses. Read: ""Forty-one per cent of architects now using AI"" says RIBA report Ahmed-Kristensen, who is a former head of Design Products and chair of Engineering Design at the Royal College of Art , argued that industries should be careful about how they adopt AI because it could have unexpected consequences for creative skillsets. ""Overreliance on LLMs [large language models] could lead to unexpected cognitive consequences for creatives,"" Ahmed-Kristensen said. ""Research has shown that neural connections which support memory, problem-solving and resilience can weaken, leaving even experienced professionals less able to generate original ideas or think critically under pressure."" LLMs remain far behind experts Speaking specifically about design, DIGIT Lab co-investigator and senior lecturer in design and innovation at the University of Exeter, Ji Han, said that LLMs can ""sometimes reach the level of a novice designer"" but they remain far behind the experts. ""And we don't expect this to change as we move towards AGI,"" he said. ""The ability to make unexpected connections and analogies, how we'd define true creativity is still very human."" Designers working across graphics, products, fashion, interiors and UX/UI were all included in the survey, alongside industrial, service and architectural designers. The Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA) conducted its own survey of AI adoption last year , finding that 41 per cent of UK architects are employing the technology ""on at least the occasional project"" and 43 per cent of those are happy with efficiency gains.

62,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Bankston Architectural uses tactile natural materials to create door hardware,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/16/bankston-architectural-products-hardware-dezeen-showroom/,16 October 2025 – 13:00,"Dezeen Showroom: Australian design brand Bankston Architectural has published a selection of its latest door knobs, pulls and handles on Dezeen Showroom. Part of Bankston Architectural 's wider The Streaks collection, this chunky door pull, named Wide Guy, has a blocky form culminating in a dovetail-shaped bottom. Wide guy has a broad silhouette The range is the result of a collaboration with Australian interior design studio YSG , and is characterised by a trio of colours comprising bands of naturally colourful timbers. Wide Guy aims to make a feature of door pulls, which are often overlooked in interiors, yet present an opportunity for characterful details within interior spaces. H04 Pull Handle Long The result of a collaboration between Bankston Architectural and US design studio Civilian, this handle comprises domed ends connected by parallel metal bars. H04 Pull Handle Long takes cues from art deco architecture, with its distinctive components available in various metals, stone, wood and powder-coated finishes. The Kooky Streaker has a 45-degree tilt This door lever is also part of The Streaks, sharing the rest of the range's colour combinations in a playful, diagonally-poised orientation. Kooky Streaker comprises a lever mounted at a 45-degree angle on a disc-shaped wall plate. Zzziggurat recalls ancient Mesopotamian architecture The brand referenced ziggurats – a form of pyramid built in ancient Mesopotamia – when creating this compact yet characterful door knob. Zzziggurat has a stacked, stepped silhouette and comes in various metallic finishes, creating tactile and eye-catching yet practical knobs for doors and cupboards. The Sensible Streaker door pull is strikingly colourful Sensible Streaker is also part of The Streaks. It has a pentagonal cross-section, resulting in a tactile spine that stretches down its long length. Like the wider collection, it comes in three colour combinations: Light Band, made up of American White Ash and Australian Blackbutt; Dark Band, comprising American Walnut and Australian Red Cedar; and Colour Band, containing New Zealand Purple Heart and African Padauk. Its simple design allows the solid timber banding to take centre stage Bankston Architectural is an architectural hardware design brand based in Adelaide, Australia. It was founded in 1982 and underwent a rebranding in 2018.

63,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,RMIT researchers reimagine rammed earth by encasing it in cardboard tubes,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/15/rmit-rammed-earth-cardboard-tubes/,15 October 2025 – 19:00,"Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia have created a building material where rammed earth is encased in permanent cardboard formwork, eliminating the need for cement. Typically, rammed earth walls are made by compacting layers of soil mixed with about 8 to 10 per cent cement inside temporary moulds designed to improve strength and durability. Once the moulds are removed, the stabilised earth forms a dense, heavy wall. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ( RMIT ) team said that by keeping the compacted earth confined within lightweight cardboard tubes, they can eliminate the need for cement, creating a low-carbon, lightweight, and thermally insulating composite that could be used for low-rise and modular buildings. RMIT researchers have devised a system that combines cardboard and rammed earth The findings were recently published in the journal Structures , and the researchers estimate the material could be ready for commercial testing within one to two years. By combining rammed earth with cardboard into a new material called CCRE (cardboard-confined rammed earth), the researchers believe they can further reduce embodied carbon while also providing a useful recycling pathway for waste cardboard. Today, buildings and construction materials like concrete and steel contribute 37 per cent of the world's annual CO2 emissions. The cement industry alone is responsible for 8 per cent. This has caused a reckoning among architects and engineers , who now seek low-carbon alternatives such as mass timber, adobe or rammed earth. An ""ultra-low-carbon building resource"" At the same time, the use of cardboard as a packaging material has surged with the e-commerce boom, causing mounting waste management challenges. In 2020 and 2021, for example, cardboard and paper accounted for 7.7 per cent of all waste generated in Australia , with a staggering 2.2 million tons sent to landfill. ""This creates both an environmental challenge and an opportunity,"" Dr Jiaming Ma, one of the study's lead researchers, told Dezeen. ""Repurposing cardboard for construction not only diverts it from landfill but also transforms it into a valuable, ultra-low-carbon building resource."" The researchers say they have eliminated the need for cement In conventional rammed earth construction, soil is compacted inside temporary formworks – usually made of plywood or steel – that give the wall its shape. Once the earth hardens, the formworks are removed, leaving behind a freestanding wall. With CCRE, the cardboard acts as permanent formwork. ""Continuous confinement to the rammed earth core"" ""It not only performs the same shaping role during construction but also provides continuous confinement to the rammed earth core,"" said Ma, noting the synergies between the two materials: the cardboard increases the rammed earth's strength and resistance to cracking or seismic forces, while the earth reinforces the cardboard's compressive performance by more than tenfold. The team was informed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, who pioneered the use of structural cardboard in temporary shelters , pavilions , and various structures. Ma cited Ban's Cardboard Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand, which was completed in 2013, and sparked the idea of combining the cardboard's structural properties with rammed earth. Read: Shigeru Ban marries thatch and cardboard tubes at Farmer's Restaurant in Japan So far, the team has built small-scale CCRE prototypes to evaluate the material's mechanical strength, carbon footprint, and life-cycle performance. Ma said the prototypes showed that CCRE's compressive strength is comparable to cement-stabilised rammed earth, and has roughly one-quarter of concrete's embodied carbon. The team has also developed a related version using carbon-fibre confinement, which they say achieves strength levels comparable to high-performance concrete. The product has roughly one-fourth of concrete's embodied carbon Next, the researchers plan to construct full-scale CCRE columns and to experiment with formworks that move beyond simple cylindrical shapes. They envision foldable, origami-inspired cardboard moulds that could be transported flat and quickly assembled on-site, opening the door to custom, modular, and easily deployable construction systems.

They envision foldable, origami-inspired cardboard moulds that could be transported flat and quickly assembled on-site, opening the door to custom, modular, and easily deployable construction systems.

64,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,William Morris-inspired AI is powered by an old treadle sewing machine,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/10/william-morris-inspired-ai-design/,10 October 2025 – 05:00,"An AI model is infused with the socialist ideals of William Morris and operated by pressing the treadle of a vintage foot-powered sewing machine in this project by recent Central Saint Martins graduate Max Park. Park 's project combines artificial intelligence with the life story and philosophies of Morris, a pioneering textile designer of the British Arts and Crafts movement who was also well-known in his time as a poet, author and socialist thinker. Titled Prompting Nowhere , the project is named after Morris's utopian novel News from Nowhere, which saw the writer develop his vision of an anti-industrialist, egalitarian world, where craft and art is the backbone of society and people live enriched by beauty. Max Park created a William Morris-inspired AI that is powered by a treadle sewing machine Park wanted to explore what an AI – specifically a large language model, in the vein of ChatGPT or Claude – might look like in a future that lived up to Morris's ideals. So he made one using a vintage Singer treadle sewing machine, which he modified so that the pedal powers a computer instead of sewing stitches. Park explained his thought process in a video essay made to accompany the project, which he undertook as part of his postgraduate degree in industrial design at Central Saint Martins (CSM). Tapping the treadle turns the flywheel to charge the battery ""My grandparents were both craftspeople,"" he said. ""My grandad repaired watches, and my nanna was a seamstress, and their flat in Walthamstow was actually just down the road from where William Morris grew up. And I think because of that, I've always had this real interest in him."" Reading News From Nowhere, he was inspired by Morris' vision for an egalitarian society built on craft, but he felt like ""we're losing this future"". ""Literally, with what we're doing to the planet, but also the things we make, the technologies which shape us – both of which I contribute to through what I might call my craft of industrial design,"" Park said. The AI prioritises data relating to William Morris and his philosophies ""They seem to be creating an environment with completely different ideals to Morris's world,"" he added. ""And I was thinking, if he were still alive, how might Morris suggest we get out of this mess?"" The connection of manual effort to output by way of treadling is one of the ways Park's generative AI differs from those we commonly use today. There are also differences in how the model has been trained and how the data is processed. While for practical reasons, Park did not do all of the training himself – instead using a small version of Meta's Llama 3.2 model – he ""fine-tuned"" the dataset with Morris's writing and told it to prioritise that data in answers. Read: Walthamstow FC unveils William Morris-informed floral kits For the processing, the AI is run and its data is stored locally on the Raspberry Pi 5 computer, bypassing the cloud platforms that have become central to AI use. Park told Dezeen that he considers the locality of processing to be the most important part of the project. ""It was an attempt to try and reclaim a sense of ownership over artificial intelligence, and I think that that reflects what Morris was trying to do with the Arts and Crafts movement,"" he explained. ""It was not an entire rejection of industrialisation, but it was highlighting some of the problems that can come when all of the power and the ways things are being produced are centralised and being controlled by a small group of people, and how that can then really negatively impact the people who are putting in the labour."" The critical design project is meant to spark discussions about AI Park believes that both the way we interact with AI and the way we produce it, through a vast but largely invisible infrastructure of human workers and material resources, deserve examination. But he was only able to do so much on a physical level. The other ideas are developed in a research paper , which reflects on whether AI can be considered a crafting tool, the skill involved in writing questions and interpreting answers, and concerns about plagiarism and intellectual property, among other things. Park developed his ideas through expert interviews with the likes of futurist Brian David Johnson and William Morris Gallery curator Róisín Inglesby, to which he took a portable version of his treadle-powered machine in the form of a simple box with a hand crank, allowing the AI to be involved in the discussions. Park also created a smaller hand-cranked version of the AI Park's hope is that his work, which isn't intended to be a prototype for a literal product but rather a work of critical or speculative design, prompts people to think differently about AI. ""The main takeaway for me is that we can do AI differently, and this is just one way of thinking about it,"" said Park. ""I think to move forward with AI in ways which truly positively impact people and planet, I think we really have to look at not just using them but creating them in radically different ways."" Park's project won him a MullenLowe NOVA Award for Fresh Creative Talent, the main award for CSM design students. Other recent projects from CSM students have included WoolTech electronics made from wool and the Tilt planter , which allows people to observe the rhythms of their plants' growth. Prompting Nowhere is on display at the Re:generating Creativity exhibition at CSM's Lethaby Gallery in Kings Cross, London until 7 December.

65,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Blast Studio launches Cupsan biomaterial made from London coffee cups,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/10/08/blast-studio-cupsan-biomaterial-design/,08 October 2025 – 05:00,"London's discarded takeaway coffee cups are given a long and useful life in Cupsan, a new biomaterial that local design practice Blast Studio has started producing at scale. A warm and flecked material marrying the textural qualities of stone and earth, Cupsan comes in high-density boards that can be used similarly to MDF. It can also be moulded into shapes to make objects such as pendant lights. Blast Studio has been quietly presenting versions of Cupsan for years, as the material initially served as the substrate for the designers' pioneering work with mycelium . Cupsan is a biomaterial made of used coffee cups Mycelium can be grown on many carbon-rich waste materials such as straw and sawdust, but Blast Studio began using single-use coffee cups as its solution soon after relocating from Paris to London in 2019. ""In London, we were struck by the sheer number of people walking around with takeaway coffee cups,"" Blast Studio co-founder Paola Garnousset told Dezeen. ""We also knew how problematic these cups are for recycling – they're lined with plastic and contaminated with food, so most of them end up in landfill."" However, the designers eventually began focusing less on mycelium and more on their paper-pulp substrate after realising the mycelium had its limitations, while their substrate was strong enough on its own. The material has a texture like stone or terrazzo but is warm to the touch ""Mycelium requires sterilisation, very controlled growth conditions, and it's slow to scale,"" said Garnousset. ""Not using mycelium meant we could reduce energy demand, scale production more easily, and create a more functional material for interiors."" The team's path to commercialising Cupsan was set when their supplier, waste-management company First Mile , delivered a full tonne of the single-use coffee cups to their door. In that moment, the designers were hit by the scale of the problem, realising that it represented only one out of the 30,000 tonnes of coffee cup waste the UK produces every year – and that very little was being done with it. ""We understood that if we wanted to have a real impact, we had to step out of the lab and confront the realities of the construction and waste industries,"" said Garnousset. The biomaterial can be used to create furniture like this Opendesk booth The studio is manufacturing Cupsan independently and is selling it primarily as a board, with each square metre containing around 840 coffee cups. Blast Studio says the finished material can be cut, drilled, nailed, varnished and glued just like wood, and that it is similarly ""forgiving"", as it can be sanded and repaired in different ways to give it new life. To make the material, Blast Studio shreds and sterilises the cups to create a paper pulp, removing their plastic lining during the process. The designers add a plastic-free binder to hold the fibres together and leave it to cure, during which time the material's agglomerated texture forms naturally. The binder is a bio-based formula made from starch and plant-derived gums. Read: PlasticFree makes database of hundreds of plastic alternatives ""forever free to all"" They sometimes add pigments – mainly natural ones such as ochres, charcoal and chalk – and have also experimented with waste streams such as brick dust to colour the material. It is also possible to harness the existing colour in the packaging waste, as the studio once did with the red coffee cups from UK chains Gail's and Costa Coffee, yielding a pale pink board. The studio has also begun testing ways to make small design pieces out of the plastic lining, which is removed during the production process and constitutes around five per cent of each coffee cup. Custom panels of the material feature in London's Happy Sky Bakery Blast Studio also undertakes custom projects involving Cupsan, where it uses the client's own waste streams. For instance, the designers worked with TMTO Architecture on the Happy Sky Bakery in central London, which features lampshades and panels made using waste coffee cups from the store's other location. Garnousset says that from its early days working with coffee cups, Blast Studio has loved the idea of taking something ordinary and short-lived and transforming it into something that lasts. The biomaterial is made with a plastic-free binder ""In a way, it's like bringing the coffee cup back into the form of a tree,"" said Garnousset. ""For us, the cup has become a symbol of the megacity, of speed and disposability."" ""By reworking it into Cupsan, we try to slow it down, transforming it into a material that could last for decades."" Blast Studio's previous work has included the Tree Column , which was 3D printed with living mycelium and could be harvested for mushrooms before becoming a structural building element.

The project involved ""a subtle refresh"" of Microsoft's 10 core Office icons for everyday applications ranging from email to Word and PowerPoint. The Microsoft Word icon is now composed of three stacked rectangles rather than four Each icon is similar to its predecessor, but updated with curvier shapes that wrap around each other and more vivid colours presented in gradients on each graphic . The Word icon, for example, is now composed of three stacked rectangles rather than four, simplified to improve legibility and reduce ""visual noise"". Other icons feature subtle rearrangements of their softened shapes. This is the first time the Office icons have been rebranded since 2018 Microsoft also decided to maintain the icons' letter plates to make the graphics ""instantly recognisable"". Jon Friedman, corporate vice president of design and research for Microsoft 365, said that the ""small but significant"" rebrand shows ""how AI is shifting the discipline of design and the nature of product development"". Read: Microsoft unveils dual-screen folding Android smartphone Friedman explained that the goal was to swap sharper edges and lines for smoother folds and curves to give the icons a sense of playfulness and approachability. The project is the first rebrand of the icons since 2018. The updated icons are expected to be rolled out within the coming weeks for web, desktop and mobile users. In other Microsoft news, the software giant commissioned architecture studio Gensler to design a pair of data centres with a hybrid CLT structure in northern Virgina, USA, at the start of the year. The goal was to swap sharper edges and lines for smoother folds and curves Brands around the world are constantly tweaking their visual identities, much to the delight or dismay of their customers. Recent subtle rebrands featured on Dezeen have ranged from an update to Google's world-famous G icon to a refreshed brand identity for American retailer Walmart that was designed to be bolder and brighter than its former 2008 iteration while remaining largely similar.

The Word icon, for example, is now composed of three stacked rectangles rather than four, simplified to improve legibility and reduce ""visual noise"". Other icons feature subtle rearrangements of their softened shapes. Microsoft also decided to maintain the icons' letter plates to make the graphics ""instantly recognisable"". Jon Friedman, corporate vice president of design and research for Microsoft 365, said that the ""small but significant"" rebrand shows ""how AI is shifting the discipline of design and the nature of product development"". Friedman explained that the goal was to swap sharper edges and lines for smoother folds and curves to give the icons a sense of playfulness and approachability. The project is the first rebrand of the icons since 2018. The updated icons are expected to be rolled out within the coming weeks for web, desktop and mobile users. In other Microsoft news, the software giant commissioned architecture studio Gensler to design a pair of data centres with a hybrid CLT structure in northern Virgina, USA, at the start of the year. Brands around the world are constantly tweaking their visual identities, much to the delight or dismay of their customers. Recent subtle rebrands featured on Dezeen have ranged from an update to Google's world-famous G icon to a refreshed brand identity for American retailer Walmart that was designed to be bolder and brighter than its former 2008 iteration while remaining largely similar.

67,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,AA Design & Make students devise simple way to build with tree forks,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/29/aa-design-make-tree-forks-architecture/,29 September 2025 – 05:00,"Students from London's Architectural Association have developed a low-cost and easily repeatable way to build with tree forks – a type of timber that is usually discarded as waste even though it is unusually strong. The project, titled A Forest Datum, saw the students design and build an elevated forest walkway by cutting the tree forks using a simple but adaptable jig. The jig trims the irregularly shaped tree forks to workable dimensions while still maintaining their structurally advantageous Y shape. The Architectural Association's Design & Make students built with tree forks The project took place within the AA's Design & Make course , which sees staff and students live and work within the industrial woodland of the university's Hooke Park satellite campus in Dorset, England. There, the students are challenged to work with the site's waste streams and test new ideas by fabricating experimental structures at full scale. In previous years the course has also involved low-value timbers, but co-director Emmanuel Vercruysse told Dezeen that the staff had pushed the challenge further for the 2025 cohort by focusing on small forking branches. ""We know that forks are, from an engineering point of view, the strongest part of the tree, because all the grain is completely intertwined,"" said Vercruysse. They made an elevated walkway across their woodland campus Usually, these parts of the tree are left on the woodland floor during industrial harvesting, but for this project, the foresters obtained them through high pruning, leaving the rest of the plant in good health. To work with the irregularly shaped forks, the students conceptualised each one as diagonally filling an invisible block of the same size and shape. The tree forks are imagined to diagonally cross an invisible building block These blocks would be stacked against other to make a flooring structure with the forks supporting each other in a long zigzag. With this method, the tree forks can vary in shape, as long as their ends are cut in line with the block edge. To trim the forks precisely, the students devised the jig, which is essentially made of three planks of wood and several adjustable 3D-printed connectors to hold the fork in place. A sled jig, it slides along tracks beside a band saw to enable quick and precise cutting. A special jig determines how the forks are trimmed To create the walkway, the forks are pressed diagonally against timber battens and pulled tight with a tensioning system of Dyneema cables to secure the structure. The tension can be relieved to free the parts for disassembly. Vercruysse said the Forest Datum process is ""highly repeatable"". It is also intentionally low-tech, even though the Design & Make staff have previously oriented towards robotics, so that it can be applied even in potentially low-income countries. ""We are really excited about this project because the material is widely available,"" said Vercruysse. ""You don't need any funding for it. The only thing you need is a community to build it, a bandsaw and a jig."" Read: MIT engineers build load-bearing structures using tree forks instead of steel joints He said the method can be used to make roof, floor and wall structures, anywhere where there is a forest. ""We don't have to lug a 500-kilo, six-axis robotic arm with us,"" he said. ""All the intelligence sits in the jig. And that's, I think, the genius of the project."". The jig determines the exact place to cut the tree forks He hopes that the work the AA is doing at the Hooke Park campus will drive a rethink in how timber is used. Currently, he said, using just 50 per cent of a standing tree would be seen by the timber industry as highly efficient, but that amount is not sustainable ""Everyone says timber is going to save our built environment, but there's just not enough timber to go around to do that,"" he said. At Hooke Park, they are now managing to use about 80 per cent of the tree, he estimated. They used beech for the forks and cedar for the other components of the 15-metre walkway, although those woods were purely selected for testing purposes and are not the ideal species for durability. The tree forks are held in place with an undoable tensioning system The Design & Make course has also previously worked with forked branches to build a barn in 2016 , although that involved a more high-tech process where every fork was 3D scanned to determine the arrangement. They have also used steam-bending techniques to create a lattice-framed shelter .

The all-in-one wearable patch tracks vital signs like temperature and heart rate when worn on the chest, with AI detecting early warning signs of overheating. ""We wanted to create something easy to wear, comfortable, and unobtrusive, something workers could forget they even had on, while still being able to monitor multiple signals simultaneously,"" Chicas told Dezeen. Nurse scientist Roxana Chicas has designed a device to help keep farmworkers safe in the heat Named SENSE Biopatch, the device uses sensors to monitor multiple physiological signs at once, including skin temperature, hydration, heart rate, variability, physical activity and blood oxygen levels. ""By integrating these data streams, the biopatch provides a comprehensive view of how heat exposure affects the body,"" Chicas explained. ""Our goal is that AI algorithms will then analyse the signals in real time to identify patterns and predict potential adverse health events, enabling real-time alerts and interventions."" The wearable biopatch monitors vital signs such as heart rate and skin temperature Chicas, who migrated from El Salvador to the US at age four and is a trained nurse, designed the device after growing up hearing stories of the ""back-breaking work"" her father and others did in construction and landscaping. ""I often found myself interpreting for workers who had been injured,"" she described. ""Being bilingual and bicultural allowed me to bridge these worlds, but I realised it wasn't enough.""

The device incorporates AI technology To refine the patch's shape and functionality, Chicas and her team conducted a study with 178 farmworkers. This followed two smaller pilot studies that tested adhesives capable of staying in place despite heavy sweating.

69,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"""The idea of designing for virtual worlds is just getting started""",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/25/metaverse-sarah-housley-opinion/,25 September 2025 – 09:30,"Rumours of the metaverse 's demise are greatly exaggerated – particularly when it comes to designing virtual buildings, writes Sarah Housley . An article about the metaverse? Is it 2020? No futures vision has burned more brightly or been abandoned more quickly this decade than the metaverse. But like all ""failed"" futures, the metaverse has not gone. It's still being developed, away from the spotlight, and the idea of designing for virtual worlds is just getting started. The metaverse is widely considered to have entered a winter On the Gartner Hype Cycle , a model that the tech industry widely references to measure the buzz, development and adoption of emerging technologies, it would be fair to place the metaverse firmly on the down slope, in the ""trough of disillusionment"". The hype has moved on, and the metaverse is widely considered to have entered a winter: a period of time where investment reduces and technological advances slow down. And yet, social virtual worlds are still being used every day. Roblox now has 111 million daily active users and 380 million monthly users , and hit an all-time high concurrent user count on 12 July, with 32 million players on the platform. Other online worlds have much smaller numbers of regular users but enjoy tight-knit communities, where the focus is often less on gaming and more on worldbuilding. Fast-growing social virtual reality (VR) platform VRChat hit almost 67,000 concurrent users in January this year. Second Life has 500,000 monthly active users ; Meta's social VR platform Horizon Worlds has roughly 200,000 . Read: Digital fashion means designers' ""imagination can go wild"" says Roblox vice president More than half of Roblox users are under 16. Young people are growing up in virtual spaces, and as they do so they're designing these spaces too. Virtual architecture is developing its own culture and customs, which are specific to each platform: in Fortnite's build battles , the built environment is constructed and shot down, in real time, during combat; in VRChat, thousands of people collaborated recently to co-construct a monument . So far, buildings in the metaverse have generally mimicked the architectural styles that are familiar offline. Over time, virtual spaces will develop their own design language – and there's so much to try out. Now the big tech companies have moved on, there's room for DIY creativity to shine Virtual designers can erase laws of gravity and physics, and introduce different modes of sensory perception. Ustwo's indie game Monument Valley (pictured top) hints at some of the aesthetic and experiential possibilities, with its Escher-like staircases and rotating islands. In metaverse designs, rooms can become bigger as you walk through them, and elements such as colour, light, texture and shape can shift in response to biometrics and sensed emotions. In Deep Reality , a VR project by the MIT Media Lab's Fluid Interfaces group, an underwater environment responds to the signals collected and processed from a headset and wristband the participant is wearing, changing to relax the wearer and slow their heart rate. We can choose to immerse ourselves in extreme and challenging spatial environments, knowing that we can exit immediately if needed. Cave Crave , a VR spelunking experience by 3R Games that puts you inside a claustrophobically tight cave space, begins to explore the possibilities of this. Read: Architects ""are the ones who discovered the power"" of AI imaging says Seraphinne Vallora co-founder Andreea Petrescu Virtual spaces can also be used for more straightforwardly positive reasons. A new study by the Max Planck Institute for Human Development found that virtual depictions of nature can have tangible effects on mood and state of mind. Immersing participants in a virtual forest enhanced with sound and scent reduced their stress levels and deepened their feeling of being connected to nature, the study found, suggesting that VR ""forest baths"" could have therapeutic potential in situations where nature is otherwise scarce. Commercial depictions of the metaverse – glossy adverts showing people working, socialising and relaxing as avatars – failed to convince the general public that this was a world they needed. Now that some of the big tech companies have moved on, there's room for small teams, new ideas and DIY creativity to shine. Virtual spatial design can be quick, spontaneous, instinctual and easily edited Spatial simulation sites like Rooms , which is Sims-like in its play, show the creativity that unfurls when we give everyone the tools to try out interior design. Tools like these could inspire a new generation to not only want to be designers, but more broadly, to understand the value and impact of design. Space Elevator , developed by NUMENA for the Meta Quest, is a sketching tool for creating spatial environments. Users can easily design buildings, furnish them and transplant them into different settings, choosing whether to follow conventional rules, or not. ""Users can create houses with floating furniture or experience what it's like to be in a room with walls made of water,"" said the app's UX designer Maria Nikoli . ""I discovered that users love transcending the limits of reality."" Read: ""Metaverses will be the digital equivalent of huge empty cities without character or community"" Virtual spatial design can be quick, spontaneous, instinctual and easily edited as moods or needs change. It can be designed solo or together, in a process akin to improvising music. New design processes are leaning into this flexibility. Vibe coding, which enables non-specialists to code software by prompting an AI tool, is starting to extend to ""vibe designing"" for virtual worlds. Meta has developed AI Environment Generation for Horizon Worlds so that creators can bring an entire space into existence using only a text prompt; Roblox's Cube 3D works similarly for objects and environments. It may be virtually that we see the most exciting spatial experiences emerging As virtual design becomes easier and more accessible, people who are interested in designing spaces and experiences may decide to learn how to do this virtually rather than physically. Some people will work virtually to enhance physical design processes, using digital twins and simulations to enable architects and designers to increase efficiency and resilience by modelling the life of a product or space over time. Others will design virtual worlds to be inhabited solely for their own pleasures and possibilities. Virtual spaces are not impact-free: they use energy and water and have a carbon footprint. As data centres expand to enable us to use ever more digital technologies, emissions and pollution are rising fast. To make sustainable virtual worlds, we'll need to design and power them responsibly and run them equitably. But the possibilities of virtual design are tantalising, and the tech is starting to catch up to those possibilities. It may be virtually that we see the most exciting spatial experiences emerging over the decades to come.

The metaverse is widely considered to have entered a winter On the Gartner Hype Cycle , a model that the tech industry widely references to measure the buzz, development and adoption of emerging technologies, it would be fair to place the metaverse firmly on the down slope, in the ""trough of disillusionment"". The hype has moved on, and the metaverse is widely considered to have entered a winter: a period of time where investment reduces and technological advances slow down. And yet, social virtual worlds are still being used every day. Roblox now has 111 million daily active users and 380 million monthly users , and hit an all-time high concurrent user count on 12 July, with 32 million players on the platform. Other online worlds have much smaller numbers of regular users but enjoy tight-knit communities, where the focus is often less on gaming and more on worldbuilding. Fast-growing social virtual reality (VR) platform VRChat hit almost 67,000 concurrent users in January this year. Second Life has 500,000 monthly active users ; Meta's social VR platform Horizon Worlds has roughly 200,000 . More than half of Roblox users are under 16. Young people are growing up in virtual spaces, and as they do so they're designing these spaces too. Virtual architecture is developing its own culture and customs, which are specific to each platform: in Fortnite's build battles , the built environment is constructed and shot down, in real time, during combat; in VRChat, thousands of people collaborated recently to co-construct a monument . So far, buildings in the metaverse have generally mimicked the architectural styles that are familiar offline. Over time, virtual spaces will develop their own design language – and there's so much to try out. Now the big tech companies have moved on, there's room for DIY creativity to shine Virtual designers can erase laws of gravity and physics, and introduce different modes of sensory perception. Ustwo's indie game Monument Valley (pictured top) hints at some of the aesthetic and experiential possibilities, with its Escher-like staircases and rotating islands. In metaverse designs, rooms can become bigger as you walk through them, and elements such as colour, light, texture and shape can shift in response to biometrics and sensed emotions. In Deep Reality , a VR project by the MIT Media Lab's Fluid Interfaces group, an underwater environment responds to the signals collected and processed from a headset and wristband the participant is wearing, changing to relax the wearer and slow their heart rate. We can choose to immerse ourselves in extreme and challenging spatial environments, knowing that we can exit immediately if needed. Cave Crave , a VR spelunking experience by 3R Games that puts you inside a claustrophobically tight cave space, begins to explore the possibilities of this. Virtual spaces can also be used for more straightforwardly positive reasons. A new study by the Max Planck Institute for Human Development found that virtual depictions of nature can have tangible effects on mood and state of mind. Immersing participants in a virtual forest enhanced with sound and scent reduced their stress levels and deepened their feeling of being connected to nature, the study found, suggesting that VR ""forest baths"" could have therapeutic potential in situations where nature is otherwise scarce. Commercial depictions of the metaverse – glossy adverts showing people working, socialising and relaxing as avatars – failed to convince the general public that this was a world they needed. Now that some of the big tech companies have moved on, there's room for small teams, new ideas and DIY creativity to shine. Virtual spatial design can be quick, spontaneous, instinctual and easily edited Spatial simulation sites like Rooms , which is Sims-like in its play, show the creativity that unfurls when we give everyone the tools to try out interior design. Tools like these could inspire a new generation to not only want to be designers, but more broadly, to understand the value and impact of design. Space Elevator , developed by NUMENA for the Meta Quest, is a sketching tool for creating spatial environments. Users can easily design buildings, furnish them and transplant them into different settings, choosing whether to follow conventional rules, or not. ""Users can create houses with floating furniture or experience what it's like to be in a room with walls made of water,"" said the app's UX designer Maria Nikoli . ""I discovered that users love transcending the limits of reality."" Virtual spatial design can be quick, spontaneous, instinctual and easily edited as moods or needs change. It can be designed solo or together, in a process akin to improvising music. New design processes are leaning into this flexibility. Vibe coding, which enables non-specialists to code software by prompting an AI tool, is starting to extend to ""vibe designing"" for virtual worlds. Meta has developed AI Environment Generation for Horizon Worlds so that creators can bring an entire space into existence using only a text prompt; Roblox's Cube 3D works similarly for objects and environments. It may be virtually that we see the most exciting spatial experiences emerging As virtual design becomes easier and more accessible, people who are interested in designing spaces and experiences may decide to learn how to do this virtually rather than physically. Some people will work virtually to enhance physical design processes, using digital twins and simulations to enable architects and designers to increase efficiency and resilience by modelling the life of a product or space over time. Others will design virtual worlds to be inhabited solely for their own pleasures and possibilities. Virtual spaces are not impact-free: they use energy and water and have a carbon footprint. As data centres expand to enable us to use ever more digital technologies, emissions and pollution are rising fast. To make sustainable virtual worlds, we'll need to design and power them responsibly and run them equitably. But the possibilities of virtual design are tantalising, and the tech is starting to catch up to those possibilities. It may be virtually that we see the most exciting spatial experiences emerging over the decades to come.

71,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Meta launches first AI smart glasses with integrated display,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/19/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-smart-glasses/,19 September 2025 – 10:15,"Technology company Meta has added to its Ray-Ban smart glasses series with the Meta Ray-Ban Display – its first pair to combine AI and augmented reality . Meta 's latest glasses feature a heads-up display that overlays information such as messages, captions and video calls over the view from one eye. The glasses ship with a smart wristband that enables voice-free control through subtle hand movements – a unique innovation that the Facebook parent company previewed with a paper in Nature just months ago . The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with a Neural Band wristband Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the glasses in a keynote presentation at the company's Connect conference on Wednesday. In it, he pitched the Meta Ray-Ban Display as a revolutionary device that would free people from the distractions of their smartphones while enhancing their natural capabilities. ""Our goal is to build great-looking glasses that deliver personal superintelligence and a feeling of presence using realistic holograms,"" said Zuckerberg. The glasses continue Meta's collaboration with Ray-Ban Personal superintelligence is a phrase coined by Meta to describe the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) by individuals, tailored to their personal lives and goals. ""Glasses are the ideal form factor for personal superintelligence because they let you stay present in the moment while getting access to all of these AI capabilities that make you smarter, help you communicate better, improve your memory, improve your senses and more,"" continued Zuckerberg. ""Glasses are the only form factor where you can let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you throughout the day, and very soon generate whater UI you need, right in your vision in real time."" The augmented-reality display shows information overlaid on the wearer's view The display on the glasses is designed to be big enough to see without blocking the user's vision, and to be bright and crisp enough to read even outdoors in the sun. It is invisible to anyone but the wearer and disappears when not in use. For controls, the glasses continue to offer voice control and the touch panel on the arm like the previous Meta Ray-Ban models but add what Meta is calling the Neural Band. Meta has introduced a wristband for voice-free control through subtle gestures This wraps around the wrist and reads the minute muscle movements of subtle hand gestures, such as tapping the thumb in different spots as if operating a D-pad, twisting a virtual knob to turn up the volume on music or handwriting letters to spell out a text message. Meta is describing the wristband as the world's first mainstream neural interface, because it works by reading the electrical activity of the nervous system, even if it doesn't require the type of invasive implant usually associated with this technology . This also means that the wristband can be used by people with limited arm mobility. Read: Meta envisions replacing keyboard and mouse with smart wristband The wristband is made from high-performance textiles with carbon-coated electrodes reinforced by a strong and flexible woven mesh made from Vectran, a liquid crystal polymer fibre. The plastic glasses have Ray-Ban's iconic Wayfarer silhouette, just slightly scaled up and more square, and incorporate transition lenses so as to become sunglasses when outdoors. Among other functions, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses can take photos and videos, preview these recordings to the user, provide live translations and real-time subtitles, and give context-aware assistance such as directions and reminders. Electrodes on the wristband read electrical signals from the muscles Zuckerberg demonstrated several of these uses on stage on Wednesday, although there were some glitches, which he attributed to the Wi-Fi at the venue. The Meta founder also discussed the uptake of its smart glasses, which the company has been working on for more than 10 years – nearly as long as Google's Google Glass prototype has been consigned to the dustbin. Zuckerberg said that Meta's data showed that AI glasses were ""taking off"" and that their sales trajectory was looking similar to some of the most popular electronics of all time. The glasses are capable of live captioning, among many other functions Meta representatives have previously told Dezeen that they believe that everyone who has glasses is going to upgrade to smart glasses over the next decade . When its Neural Band was previewed in July, the company suggested that it could become our primary way of interacting with computers , overtaking the keyboard, mouse and touchscreen. Meta also launched two other smart glasses models at its Connect conference – an upgrade to its display-free Meta Ray-Ban glasses and the new Meta Oakley Vanguard for high-intensity sports.

The oven is part of Gaggenau's latest range of appliances called The Gaggenau Expressive series , which includes additional appliances such as a fully automatic coffee machine and a vacuuming drawer. ﻿ ﻿ Gaggenau has launched an oven as seen in this video created by Dezeen The appliance range features a traditional, combi-steam and combi-microwave oven. All three ovens include a circular ""floating control ring"", which is positioned centrally on the glass door of the appliance. Other features of the traditional oven include a user interface that lights up when the user approaches, a full surface grill and a blue enamel interior. The oven is part of Gaggenau's latest appliance range called The Gaggenau Expressive Series Gaggenau enlisted the help of a team of artisans to hand-brush the stainless steel before the automation process began. The brand aimed to use minimal materials while constructing the ovens, and stated that the series was influenced by Bauhaus principles and modernist architecture. Custom milling techniques were used while designing the chamfered edges of the oven, aiming to bring a higher level of quality and detail to the series. It features hand-brushed stainless steel and chamfered edges The oven can reach up to 300 degrees Celsius and is equipped with a multi-point core temperature probe. The Expressive Series is the first new cavity series by Gaggenau in nearly two decades. All appliances within the series can be stacked or arranged in a variety of layouts to meet the needs of the user. The Expressive Series features a traditional, combi-steam and combi-microwave oven Dezeen previously teamed up with Gaggenau to host a filmed talk in its flagship showroom in Shanghai , which was moderated by Dezeen's China editor Christina Yao . The Gaggenau Expressive Series is available from summer 2025. To learn more about the brand, visit its website . The images are courtesy of Gaggenau.

Gaggenau enlisted the help of a team of artisans to hand-brush the stainless steel before the automation process began. The brand aimed to use minimal materials while constructing the ovens, and stated that the series was influenced by Bauhaus principles and modernist architecture. Custom milling techniques were used while designing the chamfered edges of the oven, aiming to bring a higher level of quality and detail to the series. The oven can reach up to 300 degrees Celsius and is equipped with a multi-point core temperature probe. The Expressive Series is the first new cavity series by Gaggenau in nearly two decades. All appliances within the series can be stacked or arranged in a variety of layouts to meet the needs of the user. Dezeen previously teamed up with Gaggenau to host a filmed talk in its flagship showroom in Shanghai , which was moderated by Dezeen's China editor Christina Yao . The Gaggenau Expressive Series is available from summer 2025. To learn more about the brand, visit its website . The images are courtesy of Gaggenau.

74,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,MIT students developing 3D printer that turns food waste into household objects,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/12/mit-3d-printer-turns-food-waste-objects-ai/,12 September 2025 – 19:00,"Two MIT students have developed a prototype for a 3D printer that uses artificial intelligence to transform food waste into objects such as cup holders and small containers. Unlike most 3D printers, which typically use materials like concrete or plastic, FOODres.AI works with unlikely ingredients including fruit peels, coffee grounds and leftover rice. The machine uses computer vision to analyse each ingredient and guide users until the mixture reaches the right consistency for printing. Two MIT students are developing a 3D printer that turns food waste into household items ""If the starch is not enough, it will ask you to add more starch,"" said designer Biru Cao, who developed the prototype with fellow student Yiqing Wang. The US discards more food than any other country in the world. This happens at every level of the food chain, but studies show that the average American household, in particular, wastes on average about 3 to 4.5 pounds of food per week. This means that Americans waste more than 30 per cent of the food they acquire. It leverages AI to help users create a stable mixture Many companies and non-profits have focused on reducing food waste at the source – through redistribution, composting, or upcycling – but Cao believes there is untapped potential in the waste that remains. ""We can turn food waste into something more meaningful,"" she told Dezeen. The idea was born when Cao and Wang, both with backgrounds in design and digital fabrication, noticed the large amounts of discarded food in their local cafeteria. ""We started to think, is it possible for us to print something useful?"" said Cao. The machine can create predefined forms During their research, they discovered other designers experimenting with food waste as raw material. Dutch designer Eric Klarenbeek, for example, has used algae and other organic matter in bioprinting projects , while researchers in Italy have experimented with egg shells to create tile composites for furniture . FOODres.AI, however, is dedicated solely to residential food waste. The system consists of two connected parts: a blender that grinds ingredients into a paste, and a 3D printer. A heated nozzle at the end softens the material as it is extruded. Read: Mill bin dries and shrinks food waste so it can be sent off for reuse The prototype can handle almost any food scraps, including overripe, blackened bananas, stale bread, and slightly wilted or blemished vegetables. Hard materials like nut shells and fibrous greens are too difficult to process, and anything with visible mould should be avoided for health and safety reasons. For now, the team has built a partial prototype focused on perfecting the nozzle – something Cao said was the most technically challenging component. In its current form, the printer can only produce a handful of pre-defined items, such as egg holders, cup holders and small containers. The students' next step is to develop a full version of the machine that allows for greater design flexibility. The system contains a nozzle and a printer ""We want to build an online platform and a mobile app so people can upload their 3D prints and share them with the community,"" said Cao. The pair imagine a future where the machine could become a household staple, much like the compost bin. After cooking, a user could scan their food scraps with an app, which would identify printable ingredients and calculate the required volume. The scraps would then be blended, loaded into the printer, and transformed into a fruit bowl, a doorstop or another small, functional object. Other projects that bring AI into the kitchen include a device that generates recipes based on leftovers The post MIT students developing 3D printer that turns food waste into household objects appeared first on Dezeen .","Two MIT students have developed a prototype for a 3D printer that uses artificial intelligence to transform food waste into objects such as cup holders and small containers.

75,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Five electric cars from IAA Mobility that are leading the design race,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/11/electric-cars-iaa-mobility-lead-design-race/,11 September 2025 – 08:00,"At this year's IAA Mobility motor show in Munich the spotlight was on electric vehicles , with brands including Audi and Porsche unveiling cars and concepts with features including inflatable headrests and induction charging. The city of Munich was taken over by car brands as the latest edition of the IAA Mobility motor show kicked off, with many companies launching new models even ahead of the press day on Monday. Automotive brands showed their cars and other electric vehicles in both the city's trade fair centre and among the historic buildings in Munich's old town. Below, we've collected five of the most interesting electric vehicles on show, including models that are going into production as well as concept models that look set to influence the design of upcoming cars. Audi Concept C First unveiled in Milan ahead of the Munich launch, the minimalist Audi Concept C Car was informed by the German brand's 1930s Auto Union Type C and the third-generation Audi A6. The all-electric two-seater concept car has a pared-back design that aims to demonstrate Audi 's new design philosophy to use ""minimal measures to have maximal impact "". Find out more about Audi Concept C › Avatr Vision Xpectra Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Avatr unveiled its futuristic concept vehicle, the Vision Xpectra, in a well-attended event on the Sunday before the start of IAA Mobility. The four-seater features tactile details, including inflatable headrests, and has a long, low body with a greenhouse-like roof. According to the brand's chief design officer Nader Faghihzadeh, its design will influence upcoming Avatr models. ""As EV technology and battery life continue to advance, we have the freedom to rethink the traditional car model and explore entirely new design possibilities,"" he told Dezeen. Hyundai Concept Three This compact electric vehicle from South Korean car maker Hyundai has a swooping form that was inspired by the properties of steel. The car, which was designed especially for European cities, is just a concept for now, but it will ""set the tone for its next chapter of design innovation"", the brand said. In an interview with Hyundai Design Center head Simon Loasby , he told Dezeen that ""we're due a renaissance"" in ""cool small cars, high-performance small cars"". Find out more about Hyundai Concept Three › Polestar 5 Grand Tourer Swedish electric car brand Polestar unveiled its four-door performance Grand Tourer, which is on sale now, in Munich. The car has evolved from Polestar's Precept concept, which was first unveiled in 2020, with only minimal changes. The five-metre-long, minimalist vehicle has a shape that was informed by aviation. It features the brand's in-house developed motor and ""pure Scandinavian design inside and out,"" the brand said. Porsche Electric Cayenne German brand Porsche 's all-electric Electric Cayenne, which will launch globally at the end of this year, was shown in Munich with a special coating made up of layers of conductive pigments that emit light under alternating voltages. The coat was used to demonstrate an innovation that Porsche launched at IAA Mobility: a wireless charging system. The car manufacturer said it will be the first to ""bring an 11 [kilowatt] kW charging system with a one-box base plate for battery-electric vehicles to market maturity."" To use the Porsche Wireless Charging car plate, drivers park the Electric Cayenne above the floor plate. The car, which has a Porsche Wireless vehicle plate in the underbody between the front wheels, automatically lowers and the inductive charging begins. IAA Mobility takes place in Munich from 9 to 14 September 2025. See Dezeen Events Guide for an up-to-date list of architecture and design events taking place around the world.

The following five nature-informed examples have been recently listed on our Showroom section. The cloudy and almost luminous quality of alabaster stone is imbued in Casalgrande Padana's Alabastri tile collection. The Alabastri tile collection is informed by the appearance of Alabaster The natural material has historical uses in sculpture, however the brand has recognised its potential for decorative surfaces too through Alabastri. The availability of five different size formats and colourways – black, blue, green, pink and white – facilitates diverse applications in various interiors. Beige and Tortora Lithos tiles are two of the neutral colourways in the Lithos range Portland stone, native to England's south coast, is referenced in the brand's Beige and Tortora Lithos tiles . A gently granulated appearance defines these two colourways in particular, which share sandy tones. Lithos is informed by the look of Portland stone The wider Lithos collection covers Beige, Bianco, Grigio, Nero, Taupe, Tortota colourways, all neutral in hue and all available in six size formats. Many buildings have been made from Portland stone – the tile's inspiration – including the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London. The Concept tile collection allows for the creation of interesting monochrome spaces Concept indoor tiles come in various shapes, from hexagons to rectangles, which can be mixed and matched with the range's four available colourways. The tiles have a gently dappled surface to create a dimensional finish across interior floors and walls akin to the effect created by natural stone. Concept outdoor tiles can be applied directly to turf, gravel or sand Like its indoor counterpart, the Concept outdoor range has a mottled surface. However, its outdoor version has an anti-slip finish to ensure sure footing despite changing weather conditions. It also comes in a choice of black, grey, white and a combination of grey and beige called greige, so that surfaces can be continuous between interiors and outdoor living spaces. They can be laid directly onto a variety of substrates. There are versions of the tile for indoors and out Casalgrande Padana was established over 60 years ago, and has been developing and manufacturing ceramic and stoneware surfaces and products ever since. The brand is named for its headquarters in Casalgrande, Italy, and now occupies six factories across the nation.

77,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"Hyundai ""rethinks the compact EV from the ground up"" with Concept Three",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/09/hyundai-ioniq-concept-three-compact-ev/,09 September 2025 – 07:00,"South Korean carmaker Hyundai has unveiled a compact EV concept designed specifically for driving in European cities , whose swooping form was determined by the properties of steel . Released under the manufacturer's electric sub-brand Ioniq, the Concept Three makes its global debut at the IAA Mobility 2025 motor show in Munich today. Hyundai's Ioniq Concept Three is a response to growing demand for compact EVs in Europe At just under 4.3 metres long, it is the first compact electric vehicle (EV) in the Ioniq family, which also includes the mid-sized Ioniq 5, the Ioniq 6 saloon and the recently launched Ioniq 9, a large SUV. Hyundai said the concept will ""set the tone for its next chapter of design innovation"" and signals its ""future expansion into a new vehicle category"". Hyundai design boss Simon Loasby described the concept as 80 per cent ready for mass production ""With Europe experiencing a surging demand for compact EVs – driven by urbanisation, sustainability regulations and the growing need for space-efficient solutions – the Concept Three demonstrates Hyundai Motor's vision for meeting this demand by drawing on its advanced electrification capabilities,"" the company said. The concept's emergence could signal a new direction for EV design, which has become heavily centred around larger cars as manufacturers seek to protect profit margins. The car has a sporty hatchback profile At a media preview event last week, Hyundai Design Center head Simon Loasby told journalists that Concept Three is ""80 per cent"" of the way to being production-ready. The car owes its shape to what Hyundai calls ""the Art of Steel"" – a design technique that seeks to work with the inherent bending tendencies of steel, first exhibited in the Initium concept unveiled in late 2024 and partly designed to show off the company's advanced steelworking technology. Yellow glass and wheel hubs contrast with the anodised-effect steel bodywork To emphasise the effect, sheets are fitted together cleanly and finished with an anodised effect in a tungsten grey colour. Contrasting with the grey paintwork are lemon-yellow wheel hubs and glazing, used for a ducktail spoiler as well as the windows. Combined with a dynamic roofline and vertical tailgate, the spoiler contributes to the car's sporty hatchback configuration, described by Hyundai as ""Aero Hatch"", intended to balance an aerodynamic profile with generous interior space. Designers at Hyundai used paper sculptures to devise the car's basic shape According to Loasby, the car's basic shape was first developed in the form of paper sculptures. ""Designing the Concept Three was an opportunity for us to rethink the compact EV from the ground up,"" said Loasby. ""We defined the 'Aero Hatch' typology to craft a silhouette that captures a sense of flow and becomes a beautifully proportioned sculpture."" Hyundai's signature pixelated lights feature prominently Like all of Hyundai's recently released cars, the Concept Three features pixelated lights but pushes the idea further, with ultra-thin headlights and a pixelated light display on the front grille. Two miniature pixelated screens also feature near the side-view cameras, facing out through the door windows. Inside the car, the grey-and-yellow colour scheme continues, with grey vegetable-tanned leather and ocean-waste textiles juxtaposed with a recycled-aluminium powder paint in a shade Hyundai said was inspired by the buttery Moonbeam coreopsis flower. A cartoon character called Mr Pix appears in various places around the car The doors and dash are filled with a lightweight aluminium foam left visible at the end, while soft lilac-coloured lighting in the doors, dash and central console cuts through the grey and yellow. To keep the driver's eyes on the road as much as possible, the Concept Three eschews a touchscreen dash in favour of a series of widgets arranged around the steering wheel, which would be modular and customisable. Read: Audi reveals minimalist concept car ahead of IAA in Munich Dotted around the car is Mr Pix, a cartoonish character conceived by the Hyundai designers in an attempt to inject a sense of playfulness and personality. On a similar theme, messaging around the car includes the words ""Troublemaker"" and ""Thrillseeker"" emblazoned on the driver's and front passenger's seats, respectively. Historically known for producing small, affordable cars, Hyundai is using the shift to electrification to reposition its brand by embracing a more adventurous design approach. The car is shaped with the aim of maximising cabin space while retaining a sporty aesthetic It has erected a 58-metre-wide, seven-metre-tall booth in Munich city centre for IAA Mobility that will display seven of its EVs – including Concept Three – within large glass cubes that reference the cars' characteristic pixelated headlights. More than 500,000 visitors are expected to attend the show this week. The company plans to release 21 EV models by 2030, including electrified versions of all of its cars in Europe by 2027, while transitioning its factories on the continent to renewable energy.

78,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Suri 2.0 brings new features to bioplastic electric toothbrush,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/05/suri-2-0-electric-toothbrush-design/,05 September 2025 – 08:00,"Oral care company Suri has made its first update to its electric toothbrush , known for its sustainable approach with bioplastic brush heads recycled through a takeback scheme. Suri 2.0 features an added pressure sensor, a quieter and more powerful sonic motor, and wireless induction charging – a rare feat in a product with a metal body such as Suri's aluminium one. There are also redesigned accessories, including a more rounded travel case that can now carry out its UV-C disinfection function without being plugged in, and a pebble-sized induction charging stand designed for ""countertop appeal"". The Suri 2.0 includes a redesigned travel case Suri launched its electric toothbrush in 2022 and won the Dezeen Awards public vote in the product design category in the same year. Suri co-founders Mark Rushmore and Gyve Safavi told Dezeen that they wanted to undertake a redesign now to fold in the feedback from over 12,000 reviews they have received from customers. ""This is the culmination of taking all the feedback we have received over the last couple of years, which has enabled us to redesign an all-round better brush,"" said Rushmore. ""We've kept what's great about it already, and added those additional elements."" There is also a new wireless charging stand The Suri 2.0's wireless induction charging addresses one of the weaknesses of the first toothbrush – the charging pins on its base, which some customers reported problems with as the item aged. The British company wanted to replace these with a more durable, future-forward solution, but adding induction charging, given the product's aluminium body, was a challenge. ""Induction charging in a metal body is notoriously tough – metal disrupts the magnetic field, can cause inefficiency and heat – that's why most oral care brands default to plastic,"" said Suri innovation director Seb Wetherall. Inside, the updates include a pressure sensor and a quieter motor Similarly, smartphones with wireless charging either have backs made of glass or plastic. Suri was determined to keep its slim, recyclable aluminium body, so instead it developed a solution involving software that regulates the voltage and non-conductive metals. ""Our team re-engineered the coil, power management and firmware to make wireless charging work seamlessly in the same sleek form factor,"" said Weatherall. ""The result is a fast-charging, large battery and a body that stays slim and refined."" Without the previous charging pins, the bottom of the Suri 2.0 is now smooth and seamless. It is the only difference in the toothbrush's outward appearance, with Safavi saying that the company had received no negative feedback on it and that they did not want to make changes unnecessarily. Read: Ten plastic alternatives designed to trump paper straws Inside, the updates include an advanced sonic motor with a higher amplitude – which refers to the distance covered by the toothbrush bristles during a vibration cycle – and a lower noise level of 50 decibels. Suri's next move will be the launch of new products made from the recycling of their brush heads. These heads are made from cornstarch- and castor oil-based bioplastics, and the founders say they have collected well in excess of 500 kilograms of them, with a high return rate of over 30 per cent that is ever growing. Plenty of these have already been funnelled into new commercial products by the company's recycling partner, but Suri has kept back some of the ground plastic flakes to experiment with in-house. The toothbrushes feature an aluminium body and bioplastic brush heads that can both be recycled The team have found that it is possible to make them into new heads with a high proportion of recycled content, but Safavi said that they would first have to overcome a ""consumer barrier"" – where some customers feel disgust at using a toothbrush head ""made out of other ones that have been in people's mouths"" – before bringing them to market. In the meantime, they are exploring other products. While toothbrushes may be an everyday item that many people don't closely consider, a reimagined product in this category was also shortlisted in the Dezeen Awards in the following year to Suri. {Access}ories is an adaptive toothbrush add-on that helps people with dexterity challenges brush their teeth.

Located a 10-minute walk from Governor's Island's ferry terminal, The KlimaKover pavilion is composed of several silver-clad, cooling panels that support an expansive roof made of wooden units covered in fabric shading. Henning Larsen and the University of Pennsylvania have collaborated on a pavilion located on Governor's Island in New York Henning Larsen , the Thermal Architecture Lab at the University of Pennsylvania and AIL Research created the pavilion in light of rising global heatwaves, which can prove dangerous to the public if left exposed. Powered by a rooftop solar panel , the pavilion employs radiant cooling to provide relief from heat exposure and uses ""70 per cent less energy than traditional AC"" according to its team. Protective and cooling panels sit on a concrete base. The photo is by Hanzhong Luo. Placed atop a concrete foundation, its four cooling panels intersect at the centre of the pavilion, where transparent silver membranes contain ""microtubes"" laced with chilled water. The technology, called membrane-assisted radiant cooling draws heat from people's bodies to cool them within 5 to 7 minutes, with the effect fully ""pronounced"" after 20 minutes, according to the team. Read: Can we quit our air-con addiction? ""While radiant cooling is not as well-known as radiant heating, it relies on a similar concept,"" said the University of Pennsylvania. ""The goal is to create zones where people feel cool as the panels draw heat away from their bodies. Because it doesn't require dehumidification, it doesn't cause condensation and uses 70 per cent less energy than traditional AC."" A translucent membrane is threaded with microtubes laced with chilled water. The photo is by Kabir Sahni Several other ""passive"" panels are covered in a reflective material, which bounces heat away from the exterior and cool air towards the interior of the pavilion. The pavilion's roof is made of 4 foot by 4 foot (1.2 metres by 1.2 metres) wooden cubes, each covered in a swath of fabric for further shading. Rooftop units were covered in fabric to create shading. The photo is by Kabir Sahni The structure is primarily made of an upcycled silky cedar wood product called Carbon Smart Wood , which was selected for its ease of disassembly, according to the team. Ultimately, the entire system was designed to be modular and cost-effective, so that it can be scaled up to create different arrangements for placement over public areas such as schoolyards, bus stops, markets and construction sites. ""KlimaKover will allow visitors arriving from New York City and the world to experience outdoor cooling,"" said Thermal Architecture Lab director Dorit Aviv.

80,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Hyphyn impregnates vinyl with plastic-eating enzymes to enhance biodegradation,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/02/hyphyn-biodegradable-vinyl-enzymes-design/,02 September 2025 – 05:00,"New materials brand Hyphyn has launched what it claims is a first-of-its-kind biodegradable performance vinyl fabric , which breaks down over 90 per cent in two years in landfill conditions without leaving behind microplastics or toxic chemicals. Made by US vinyl manufacturer Nassimi , the Hyphyn material decomposes almost twice as much as traditional vinyl under ideal conditions, according to an international standard test . Traditional vinyl broke down 49 per cent in the same period. This improvement is thanks to a patented plastic-eating enzyme system embedded within both the vinyl – also known as polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) – and its polyester backing. Hyphyn is a new vinyl with enhanced biodegradability The enzymes are activated only in response to landfill-specific microorganisms, which are then able to break down the material more quickly and thoroughly than they would with standard vinyl. The brand asserts this is true biodegradation, with the product breaking down into inert gases and organic matter, not just smaller plastic particles. Specifically, the PVC polymer chains are converted into methane and carbon dioxide gases – the same as any other material that biodegrades in anaerobic conditions such as landfills. While these are greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming if released into the atmosphere, they are commonly captured and converted to energy at modern landfill sites. The material is impregnated with an enzyme system that activates in landfill conditions Alternatively, if not sent to landfill, the brand says the material can be safely incinerated without emitting harmful dioxins – the toxic chemicals that usually form when chlorine-containing substances like PVC are burned. If Hyphyn's claims are true, the material can be seen as an advance on traditional vinyl, which is one of the world's most environmentally damaging plastic products. This is because traditional PVC is not only highly resistant to biodegradation but also difficult to recycle and full of volatile organic compounds that seep into the air – either slowly over time or all of a sudden under exposure to high temperatures. The vinyl was found to biodegrade by 90 per cent in two years under testing conditions However, biodegradability claims around plastic are controversial, with objects marketed as biodegradable sometimes staying undamaged in the environment for years . This is also the case with the standardised ASTM D5511 test used here, which has been criticised for relying on an ideal anaerobic environment that is not reflective of real life. Traditional vinyl, for instance, can be found virtually intact in nature decades later – even if, in this test, it was found to biodegrade 49 per cent. The testing company itself stipulates that the ASTM D5511 results should not be used to make generalised claims about the biodegradability of a material without tying them to concrete percentages achieved under these specific conditions. Read: Is a plastic-free future possible? As such, while Hyphyn will likely biodegrade faster and cause less damage than traditional vinyl in real-world landfill environments, it may not reach the 90 per cent in two years achieved in testing. Nassimi executive vice-president Iwan Nassimi told Dezeen that he understands and appreciates any scepticism around sustainability claims. That's why the biodegradability tests, as well as a raft of other test results, are made publicly available on the company's website . ""It was very important for us to verify any claim with independent lab testing,"" Nassimi said. ""The biodegradability testing takes a long time as it's in real time, and we conducted each test twice at different certified labs in order to verify results."" Manufacturer Nassimi says it delivers the performance of vinyl while being more sustainable When it comes to soil and material toxicity, the tests confirm that the material is free of lead, PFAS and formaldehyde. Other potentially hazardous metals are either not detected or below the allowable regulatory limit in the US, where the testing was carried out. An incineration test conducted in Taiwan suggests that the material can be burned safely, because the dioxin levels measured in the ash are very low. Read: The Dezeen guide to plastic in architecture, design and interiors The company did not test for chlorine or hydrogen chloride gases, which are a continuing cause for concern because many countries, including the UK, favour burning over landfill disposal, designer and sustainability expert Sophie Thomas told Dezeen. However, Nassimi maintains that in the case of vinyl upholstery, dioxins are the primary concern since they are carcinogenic and persist in the environment. Thomas, who has argued for a ban on PVC , also questioned the continuing use of petrochemicals as the feedstock for the material, as opposed to a bio-based alternative, doubting whether PVC could ever truly be made sustainably. The company makes its test results publicly available ""This is a material that's incredibly problematic, not only from the end-of-life perspective but actually the way that we make it, it's an incredibly energy-intensive material,"" said Thomas. ""This energy usage is never captured when you look at the life-cycle assessment of the material, because it's actually in the production of the raw materials themselves."" As well as vinyl, PVC is commonly used in construction for elements including pipes, window and door frames, cladding and floor coverings. It is also used to make items such as ""vegan leather"" handbags, credit cards and vinyl records.

82,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Four of the best dumbphones for a digital detox,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/28/best-dumbphones-reviewed-digital-detox/,28 August 2025 – 10:30,"The most desirable phones are no longer only the ones with the most advanced features. Here, contributing editor Rima Sabina Aouf reviews four of the best contemporary dumbphones with deliberately pared-back functionality. A dumbphone – sometimes called a feature phone or brick phone – has a basic set of features and minimal internet connection. The idea is by doing less, it frees you to do more – more focusing on your work, more being present with your family and friends, more looking up when you're out in the world. After a few years hovering in the background of mobile phone design, dumbphones are stepping into the mainstream. Consumer desire for a change from their distracting smartphones is rising to a clamour that has seen new launches from the likes of Fairphone try to add dumbphone-like features to their products . For those who are ready to try a new device, we've put the best dumbphones available in the UK to the test. Completely replacing your smartphone with one of these devices will be an impossibility for most users, but I tried using each as my primary phone with my iPhone as a back-up that lived in my room. Light Phone 3 by Light and Foxconn Apps: calendar, camera, maps, podcasts, music, notes, alarm, timer, calculator, hotspot Pros: appealing text-based black-and-white interface, handsome hardware design, practical app selection, effective dashboard for syncing, good speaker, hotspot included Cons: limited battery life, not ergonomic for calls, pricey, no autocorrect Score: 8.5/10 Released earlier this year, the Light Phone 3 is probably the first contemporary dumbphone to feel aspirational, thanks to the attractive design of its hardware and operating system. Many electronics designers claim to channel the influence of German industrial designer Dieter Rams , but in the Light Phone 3 – with its square edges, perforated metal speaker grill, and tactile knob and buttons – you can really see it. There is also a dash of Teenage Engineering to it, with the device looking a bit like a monochromatic shadow of the Rabbit R1 . The Light Phone 3 has an attractive text-based interface The Light Phone 3's text-based, black-and-white operating system, Light OS, is equally appealing. The use of the sans-serif Akkurat font by Lineto foundry brings both personality and legibility, while the stripping back of usually visual apps like podcasts and the calendar to a pure text format is surprisingly calming and lovely. Light moved away from the e-ink screen with the Light Phone 3, and it was worth the risk. While no other screen may be as peaceful for viewing text as e-ink, for image-based apps like maps and the camera, the latter of which is in full colour, the high refresh rate of the AMOLED display enhances usability. Instead, it's the screen's matt finish and the pronounced use of black – where pixels are actually turned off, not emitting light – that bring a feeling of quiet and make it completely different to looking at a smartphone. The screen only shows colour for photos The Light Phone 3's other big successes are the well-functioning online dashboard, which provides easy syncing, and the app selection. While it's almost impossible to please everyone with a limited app choice, the Light Phone 3's is extensive enough that many people should find they can use it as their ""daily driver"" – the tech collectors' term of choice for their everyday phone. Calls and messages are easy, the 50-megapixel sensor takes decent photos, there are music and podcasts to entertain you on your commute, maps ensure you won't get stranded when you're out, and the calendar is very usable, since it syncs with iCal or Google, unlike any of the others on this list. In reality, the only absence that truly frustrated me was autocorrect – forget touch typing without it. The other main downsides are the cost and the battery life – similar to a new iPhone, but without the hours of daily usage to account for it. Mudita Kompakt by Mudita Apps: alarm, calculator, camera, chess, e-reader, maps, meditation, music, notes, voice recorder, weather Pros: restful on the eyes, great hand feel especially with the silky silicone case, long battery life, option to sideload additional apps, hotspot option in settings Cons: slow screen refresh rate, Mudita Center syncing app not fully functional, no autocorrect Score: 7/10 The Mudita Kompakt is ideal for people whose main problem with their smartphone is the screen. E-ink works fundamentally differently to OLED displays, which are made up of millions of pixels that emit light. Instead, e-ink screens only reflect ambient light; they do not emit any themselves. So whereas there is good reason to feel like looking at your smartphone is like glimpsing into a Vegas casino, looking at the Mudita Kompakt is as restful as opening a book. One of the most endearing features of the Mudita Kompakt is its slightly eccentric choice of custom apps. Chess, meditation and an e-reader might not be everyone's go-to, but they suggest a clear vision of the kind of lifestyle the device is built to support: mindful, healthy and self-improving. It makes sense, given that the company's name refers to a Buddhist conception of joy. It is a lifestyle that I think will appeal to many dumbphone-curious consumers, and one that I enjoyed leaning into. The Mudita Kompakt has an e-ink screen Unfortunately, however, these apps aren't perfect. The meditation app only offers a timer and a chime, and the e-reader has very limited customisation options, meaning it is stuck on a default with annoyingly poor word spacing. That leaves Kompakt users with a difficult choice: stick with the cohesive but limited custom apps, or dilute the purity of the experience and load third-party apps. The Kompakt is rare among dumbphones in allowing this, and even potential distractors like WhatsApp or social media can be unofficially installed. While this means you get the apps of your choosing, it comes with the trade-off of visual chaos, with apps not designed for this type of screen or operating system. The phone is designed to support a mindful lifestyle Ultimately, it's the user's level of enthusiasm for e-ink that is going to be the decisive factor with the Kompakt. Anyone who is familiar with the slow refresh rate of these screens will be able to imagine how glitchy and almost comical it is to use maps or a camera preview. For me, it was too frustrating – even more frustrating than the Light Phone 3's lack of autocorrect, which the Kompakt shares. As for the photos themselves, once transferred to a computer, I quite liked their lo-fi, almost film-like quality, although given the sensor is just eight megapixels, it is technically a big downgrade from contemporary smartphone offerings. Punkt MP02 by Punkt Apps: calendar, clock, notes Pros: classic Jasper Morrison design, privacy conscious, comfortable to hold to the ear for calls, hotspot option Cons: no camera, no maps or any apps for entertainment during a commute, unintuitive interface Score: 6.5/10 Punkt's art director and the designer of the MP02 is Jasper Morrison . Suffice to say, the design is the selling point here. The MP02 not only looks elegant with its minimalist calculator-like design, but it is the lightest, most compact and most ergonomic-feeling in the hand of any dumbphone on this list. It is perfect for consumers who primarily want a phone they can use for calls, as it is comfortable to hold to the ear for long periods and won't get hot. However, the market for this kind of phone must be vanishingly small. And it has virtually no apps. No map to guide you home. Not one thing to distract you on a commute. Even the calendar ""app"" is just a table of days and dates – do not think that you can add an event or a meeting to it. The Punkt MP02 is compact and elegant Instead, what the MP02 does provide is a secure Wi-Fi hotspot. The usage pattern it seems to envision for its users is one where they carry at least two devices most of the time – their MP02, and a smartphone, tablet or computer that they can tether to it, should they need. This could work well for some professionals, allowing a truly minimal phone experience. One of the the MP02's lesser known strengths is privacy. With the option to download a custom app called Pigeon based on the Signal protocol, it gives users end-to-end encyrpted messaging and calls over Wi-Fi or mobile data with anyone else using a Signal app. It is a great phone for making calls The most bemusing aspect of the design is its approach to user experience. It is – apparently deliberately – unintuitive to use. Instead of users finding that the MP02 ""just works"", a la Apple, Punkt encourages them to ""learn its features in a systematic manner"", by reading the 56-page instruction manual cover to cover. It said that they will then know exactly how the entire phone works, making a ""refreshing change"" from the byzantine nature of smartphones. I'm not convinced this is preferrable. I did, unexpectedly, enjoy the throwback to the T9 keypad – a truly quick way of typing once you get in the habit, aided by the size and responsiveness of these particular keys. However, this also seems to be one of the phone's weaknesses, with many users reporting missed presses and incorrect readings with age. Nokia 2660 Flip by HMD Apps: camera, Opera browser, music, radio, calculator, voice recorder, clock, games, torch, calendar, several games including Snake Pros: snap-shut-to-hang-up mechanism, price, retro appeal, easy to use, long battery life Cons: no hotspot, no map, inclusion of potentially distracting apps, big when open Score: 5/10 It is in some ways unfair to Nokia to compare the 2660 Flip to the other phones on this list. While those are designed with the latest technology, deliberately pared back, the 2660 is a lightly retouched version of the 2760, a phone designed with the latest technology of 2007. However, Nokia is proving its old phones have staying power, with nostalgia and renewed appreciation for the pioneering design driving consumers to the devices, now produced by licensee HMD. There are two factors in particular that recommend the 2660 Flip: a two-figure price tag and the satisfying snap-shut-to-hang-up mechanism, for so long lost in personal electronics. It's a haptic delight that seems to have made the phone particularly popular among Gen Zs. However, by today's standards, the app offering here is shambolic. It includes a radio but no maps. There are no podcasts or even notes, but there is a web browser and several simple but addictive games – both potential time-sucks that new dumbphone designs avoid. Opening it up to install the SIM is also notably awkward. And given that many dumbphone users switch phones semi-regularly, the lack of SIM card drawer alone can make the 2660 Flip an impractical choice. The post Four of the best dumbphones for a digital detox appeared first on Dezeen .","The most desirable phones are no longer only the ones with the most advanced features. Here, contributing editor Rima Sabina Aouf reviews four of the best contemporary dumbphones with deliberately pared-back functionality. A dumbphone – sometimes called a feature phone or brick phone – has a basic set of features and minimal internet connection. The idea is by doing less, it frees you to do more – more focusing on your work, more being present with your family and friends, more looking up when you're out in the world. After a few years hovering in the background of mobile phone design, dumbphones are stepping into the mainstream.

83,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"Kitchen Cosmo is a ""playful and intentional"" AI appliance that generates recipes based on leftovers",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/26/kitchen-cosmo-mit-jacob-payne-ayah-mahmoud/,26 August 2025 – 05:00,"Students from MIT have developed a retrofuturistic kitchen robot that uses AI to look at the ingredients available and makes suggestions for what to cook based on your mood, skill level and available time. Kitchen Cosmo currently exists as a functioning prototype with a bright-red body reminiscent of old-school appliances and a menagerie of different buttons, switches and sliders. MIT students Jacob Payne and Ayah Mahmoud have developed Kitchen Cosmo These allow home cooks to set their dietary preferences and mood, as well as the desired cooking time, difficulty level, number of portions and meal type. Kitchen Cosmo then uses a webcam housed in its adjustable, anthropomorphic head to capture the available ingredients, which the internal AI identifies and turns into a recipe that ticks all these boxes. A webcam in the robot's head identifies ingredients An integrated thermal printer spits out the final instructions, burnt onto unfurling paper receipts that can be torn off and stored in a clear tube at the bottom of the appliance. The entire process is screen-free and was designed by MIT students Jacob Payne and Ayah Mahmoud to be as tactile and analogue as possible. ""As AI becomes more present in daily life, most interfaces lean toward efficiency and invisibility – touchscreens, apps or voice assistants,"" Payne told Dezeen. ""With Cosmo, we wanted to challenge that default and ask what a different kind of interaction could look like."" ""The goal wasn't to make the interface seamless, but to make it tactile, playful and intentional. By designing a device that's visible on the countertop and operated through dials and switches, Cosmo foregrounds the act of collaborating with AI instead of hiding it."" Its retrofuturistic bright-red body nods to the 1969 Honeywell Kitchen Computer Payne and Mahmoud 3D-printed their prototype from PLA and finished it with red paint and aluminium accents in a nod to the 1969 Honeywell Kitchen Computer – a flopped attempt at bringing computers into households before the invention of the PC. But while the Honeywell spat out pre-programmed recipes, Kitchen Cosmo hopes to create a more creative, reciprocal relationship with the technology by letting users steer the final outcome via the machine's many buttons. The ""most novel"" of these, according to the MIT researchers, is the dial that allows home cooks to switch between six different moods based on whether they're feeling nostalgic, experimental or scavenging the fridge for leftovers. Read: Seven portable AI devices that attempt to give shape to a new technology ""These actions make the exchange with AI feel more personal and collaborative,"" Payne explained. ""Rather than being a purely transactional process, the moment of interaction helps reshape how people engage with smart technology in the kitchen."" ""Users set parameters not by typing or speaking but by turning knobs and flipping switches, each physical interaction reinforcing the sense that the device is being tuned, not commanded."" The inputs from the manual buttons, as well as from the camera and the printer, are fed into an Arduino microcontroller housed within the device, which communicates with a central computer to handle the processing, generation, and output using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. AI-generated recipes are printed out like receipts As a result, Kitchen Cosmo is liable to some of the same issues as OpenAI 's own ChatGPT chatbot. For example, the generated recipes aren't verified for taste, safety or procedural accuracy, and are mostly limited to western ingredients and techniques. But future versions of the product could integrate a more knowledgeable, custom-built AI trained on curated recipe datasets, historical cookbooks, regional food archives and specific food knowledge such as ingredient pairing graphs or flavour compound networks. The device exists as a functioning prototype In the wake of the generative AI boom spawned by ChatGPT in 2023, many other designers and brands have also set their sights on figuring out how to integrate this technology into physical products . Recent examples that explore real-life use cases include a Dream Recorder that lets users play back their dreams and the Petal camera , which produces mini nature documentaries based on footage of insects and birds in people's backyards.

The iXi trolley currently exists as a functioning prototype, created with support from product design studio Futurewave . iXi is billed as the ""world's first smart self-driving golf trolley"" Belgium-based Botronics set out to eliminate the struggle of manually pushing or pulling heavy trolleys around the golf course so golfers can focus entirely on their game. Co-founder Eric Piraux said he was inspired to create the product after driving home from the golf course in his self-driving Tesla car. It was designed to follow golfers along the course ""I wondered, why can't my golf trolley do the same?"" he said. ""So I assembled a team of top engineers to turn this dream into a reality."" Billed as the ""world's first smart self-driving golf trolley"", iXi utilises artificial intelligence software to navigate the course on its own and incorporates cameras and microphones so it can be controlled using gestures and voice commands. An integrated display shares data about the pitch and the player The device uses GPS and pre-loaded maps of more than 40,000 golf courses to plot its way around, either following the player or travelling ahead to clear the path. When the player shows iXi their hand, the trolley follows them along paths or across fairways, stopping to allow them to play their next shot. Read: Petal camera uses AI to produce nature documentaries of personal backyards A camera mounted on the front of the device recognises when the player takes their putter from the bag, prompting iXi to move automatically towards the next tee. The trolley also functions like a human caddie, providing advice on what club to use based on customised insights about the player's style and typical distances. Botronics has created a functioning prototype of the trolley The integrated display provides data including hole distances, a par score for each hole and green details, along with a digital scorecard that tracks and analyses performance. An AI-powered stereoscopic camera can record the player's swing and provide instant feedback, or share the video with a coach for analysis using the iXi app. A wide wheelbase helps to improve balance Users can relive their round on a virtual map included in the app, which can also be used to analyse footage of their swing and track performance stats. ""The goal was to create a self-driving golf trolley that mimicked the experience of having a personal caddie, offering seamless mobility and intelligent positioning on the course,"" said Futurewave co-founder and creative director Joachim Froment. ""For the user, the key benefits are hands-free mobility, real-time tracking of performance and easy transport thanks to the trolley's lightweight, robust aluminium frame and patented folding system."" This one-click folding system features colour-coded latches and hinges, designed to ensure the process of folding and unfolding the device is as simple as possible. The trolley can be folded up for easy transport iXi's battery is integrated within its frame, creating a low centre of gravity for enhanced stability. A wide wheelbase helps to improve the machine's balance and enables it to navigate slopes up to 25 degrees in gradient. The concept was presented at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas and the PGA golf show in early 2025. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, the project team is now working on transforming functioning prototypes into a production model, which it plans to deliver to customers in 2026. iXi is one of a slew of new experimental AI gadgets that are promising to transform how we leisure. Elsewhere, Marc Newson and Swarovski Optik have teamed up to create smart binoculars for birdwatchers , while the Terra AI ""compass"" would allow users to go on phone-free walks.

Lupi, who initially studied architecture in Italy, focuses her practice on information and mapping systems and how they represent ""complex narratives within urban and architectural contexts."" Her work has explored design, data and ""what it means to communicate,"" specialising in story-driven data visualisations. Lupi initially studied architecture in Italy before moving into information design A common misconception that Lupi often grapples with is that data is objective or complete. ""It's always a fragment of a story — filtered, shaped and often incomplete,"" she said. ""Understanding the human choices behind it is as important as understanding the numbers themselves."" Lupi designed the identity for the world's first lab and interactive museum dedicated to behavioural science Big numbers and infographics, however, are overrated according to the designer, who strives to challenge conventional data visualisation. ""They often oversimplify complex subjects and feel more decorative than explanatory,"" she said. With Dezeen Awards judging underway, Lupi is amongst the 60-strong industry leaders who are currently evaluating this year's entries. In keeping with her human-centric approach, Lupi is on the lookout for work that ""resonates on a human level."" Read on for five projects that best represent Lupi's work: Dear Data, Princeton Architectural Press, 2016 ""A year-long project where I exchanged hand-drawn postcards weekly with designer Stefanie Posavec, each visualising personal data from our daily lives. This analogue approach emphasised the personal and human aspects of data, challenging the notion that data is purely digital or impersonal. ""Dear Data remains [my] most important [project], it was a personal and professional turning point. It changed how I think about design, data, relationships, and what it means to communicate."" Plastic Air, Google Arts & Culture, 2021 ""An interactive experience that visualises the presence of microplastics in the air around us. The project educates viewers about the environmental impact of their behaviours by presenting this invisible pollution in an engaging and visually compelling way. ""The design mirrors the allure of plastic itself – shiny and attractive – prompting reflection on the duality of its appeal and harm."" Mindworks: The Science of Thinking, 2021 ""An immersive exhibition for the Center for Decision Research in Chicago, designed to engage the public in the mechanisms of their own minds. ""By transforming behavioural science research into interactive installations, visitors can experience and understand cognitive biases and decision-making processes firsthand. This project shows how design can make complex scientific concepts accessible and experiential."" Moleskine Foundation – Book of Life, Moleskine Foundation, 2021 ""An artist's book created for the Moleskine Foundation's collection, where I documented my life through data-driven embroidery. Each stitch represents a day of my life, with colours denoting significant events, weaving a tangible narrative of personal history."" 1-374: My Life with Long Covid, The New York Times, 2023 ""A visual narrative published in The New York Times that chronicles my four-year experience with Long Covid. With the piece, I aimed to shed light on the often invisible struggles of chronic illness by visualising the pace of my daily symptoms and struggles, and opening it up to the Long Covid community through a broader data collection at the end. ""This project culminated in a TED talk titled "" What Long Covid Taught Me About Life (and Data) ,"" where I talked about the data of my recovery, and what the data we choose to look at can teach us.""

88,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,iKKO attempts to reinvent the smartphone with AI-led MindOne,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/15/ikko-mindone-smartphone-technology/,15 August 2025 – 09:00,"Chinese tech company iKKO has attempted to subvert the norms for large smartphones with MindOne – a device that is not only small but has a single flippable camera and two operating systems, one primarily AI -focused. The unusual smartphone also includes free global internet connection without a SIM card or Wi-Fi and an optional phone case that adds a BlackBerry-style mechanical keyboard, high-quality audio and an extra battery. iKKO , a company which has so far focused on high-end audio, bills the MindOne as ""a new kind of digital companion built for creators, thinkers and travellers who seek focus and freedom"". ""Phones today are all the same: big and heavy,"" said iKKO in a product video. ""So we made something different: small, thin, stylish and smart."" The iKKO MindOne can be used with an optional mechanical keyboard The MindOne has dimensions similar to a Post-it pad, with an edge-to-edge AMOLED screen. There is no front-facing camera lens – instead, to take a selfie, the user needs to flip the rear lens up and around so it faces front. This allows the MindOne to offer the same high-quality, 50-megapixel camera for all photography instead of the usual poorer quality front-facing option, which is around 12 megapixels on current top-of-the-range phones. The camera lens flips around to take high-quality selfies Another key differentiator with MindOne is the dual operating system – one being Android 15 and the other a custom operating system that iKKO describes as lightweight and ""designed for distraction-free focus"". It centres on productivity-focused AI tools such as translation, speech-to-text note-taking, a meeting notes app that automatically generates summaries, and an ""AI Study"" app that lets users snap a picture of, for example, an equation, which it will then solve. Read: Is this the twilight of the smartphone? iKKO says the dual operating systems will allow users to take control of their time, because they can select the Android apps of their choosing to bring into the custom operating system and effectively make it into a more developed ""focus mode"". It also said that the operating systems will respect users' privacy, with no listening, data collection or advertising. In the Pro model, all of iKKO's AI tools will work out-of-the-box in over 60 countries with a free global internet collection enabled by a built-in virtual SIM (vSIM) system. For all other mobile data applications, users will need to pay to ""top-up"" the vSIM or use a physical SIM card. The phone's custom OS features AI tools such as meeting summaries The snap-on case adds a QWERTY keyboard and, in keeping with iKKO's existing audio expertise, a Cirrus Logic CS43198 digital-to-analogue converter and 3.5-millimetre headphone jack, which the company says delivers lossless, high-fidelity sound. There is also a built-in battery on the case, allowing it to double as a power bank. iKKO is positioning the MindOne as a device that can either function as a person's primary device or be used as a minimalist second phone. The phone is designed to be compact and connect to the internet during travel ""With its ultra-portable form factor, built-in AI connectivity and a philosophy centred around purposeful tech, MindOne is not trying to be the biggest phone – just the smartest, most thoughtful one,"" said iKKO. Based in Shenzhen, iKKO is best known for its high-end audio products. Its ActiveBuds earbuds also made significant use of AI, incorporating features such as a touchscreen on the case and built-in SIM allowing music streaming and phone-free calls. With MindOne, which is now available for pre-order, iKKO has become one of the first companies to try to dramatically reimagine the smartphone around new AI capabilities and consumer desire for less distraction. After years of stagnation in smartphone design, many in the technology industry are now speculating that the device will be radically reinvented – or replaced altogether . The MindOne joins the Fairphone 6 in attempting to please disillusioned smartphone users by offering something akin two phones in one, with the ability to switch to a more minimalist mode.

89,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,GM China reveals EV concept designed to evoke retro rocket ships,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/13/buick-electra-orbit-gm-china-ev-concept-car-retro-rocket-ships/,13 August 2025 – 05:00,"The Chinese division of General Motors has unveiled its Buick Electra Orbit concept car , which combines 20th-century space-age references with the latest electric vehicle technologies. The futuristic proposal was developed by GM China 's Advanced Design Center to showcase the Buick brand's creativity and technological ambition. The designers chose to incorporate nods to spacecraft, jet aeroplanes and Buick concepts from the 1950s to give the concept car a retro feel. The Buick Electra Orbit concept car was designed by General Motors These details combine with futuristic technologies such as a wormhole-inspired interface and ball-shaped controller that hint at the future of autonomous, electric vehicles. ""Electra Orbit is a bold exploration of what Buick can be when we blend heritage inspiration with visionary innovation,"" said Stuart Norris, vice president of design for GM China and GM International and chief of design at SAIC-GM. ""By reinterpreting space-age motifs and pushing electric-architecture freedoms, we wanted to create a concept that feels both familiar in its Buick DNA and thrillingly new."" The design nods to spacecraft, jet aeroplanes and Buick concepts from the 1950s The car features what its makers described as ""flagship proportions"", with a length of nearly six metres and a width of over two metres. Electra Orbit's lowered front gives the vehicle a sporty feel, while its elongated, streamlined rear evokes the spaciousness and comfort of luxury sedan cars. The external panelling incorporates deployable aerodynamic flaps that open to optimise drag and downforce at higher speeds. Scissor doors that open upwards rather than outwards reveal the interior as they pivot open, while compartments in the bonnet provide storage space for luggage. An arch-shaped display called the Ring provides an immersive digital experience The project seeks to reinforce the Buick brand's comfort-centric philosophy and the car's capacious cabin is therefore designed as an inviting and dynamic space based on a 2+2 layout. The interior continues the retro-futurism theme, featuring a design language based on the concept of orbit and outer space. A full-width instrument panel incorporates an arch-shaped display called the Ring that aims to provide an immersive digital experience.

At the centre of the instrument panel is the wormhole-inspired holographic interface, which is linked to the car's AI assistant. This combines with a globe-shaped controller designed to offer intuitive command of the vehicle functions. The colour and material palette chosen for the cabin is based on a ground theme, which the designers claimed aims to ""contrast earthly textures with cosmic inspiration"". The project seeks to reinforce the Buick brand's comfort-centric philosophy A naturally inspired red-clay tone is applied throughout the interior, including on the custom brocade-patterned upholstery that introduces a traditionally crafted detail. The fabrics combine with crystal accents and sweeping built-in lighting that emphasises the cabin's curves. These shimmering and glowing features aim to evoke celestial elements, reinforcing the design's connection to astronomy.

90,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,"""Mobile robotic factory"" deployed to create modular housing for LA wildfire recovery",https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/12/cosmic-buildings-abb-robotics-robotic-microfactories-los-angeles-wildfires/,12 August 2025 – 20:36,"US home builder Cosmic Buildings and technology company ABB Robotics have collaborated on a temporary robotic construction system housed in a tent to produce modular housing to aid in the recovery of the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year. Cosmic Buildings (Cosmic) created one of its Micro-Factories , consisting of a tent in a vacant Los Angeles plot in Pacific Palisades. It is outfitted with one large robotic arm produced by technology company ABB Robotics (ABB). Cosmic Buildings and ABB Robotics have set up a ""microfactory"" for house building in Los Angeles following the wildfires The robot, which sits at the centre of the tent, pieces together two-inch x six-inch lumber boards to create a frame, and then nails plywood pieces to the structure to create a standardised wall panel for home-building. The panels are then used to create a variety of custom modular single-family house designs by Cosmic. A singular robotic arm produces structural wall panels Two people are needed to feed the materials to the robot and to offload the finished panel. Cosmic CEO Sasha Jokic said the system produces a panel in about 20 minutes, and that the whole full frame of the house can be completed in 10 days, decreasing construction time by 70 per cent overall. ""The mobile robotic factory brings certainty and precision, which is the most important thing,"" Jokic told Dezeen. The arm first pieces together two-inch x six-inch lumber boards ""Every panel we build [with the] robot – it's precise. That means when we break the ground and start building the foundation, we start building the panels. You can start building the rest of the parts of the building at the same time."" Additional elements, such as exterior cladding, flooring, and roofing, are constructed off-site and then added to the structure. The team emphasised that solutions like these are necessary to rebuild after the devastating Los Angeles wildfires that destroyed tens of thousands of home earlier this year. ""After the wildfires burned thousands of acres, destroying homes, infrastructure, and natural habitats, this pioneering initiative will deploy the microfactory in Pacific Palisades, California, to build modular structures onsite, offering a glimpse into the future of affordable housing construction,"" said ABB. Cosmic is working with private homeowners on the project, who can approach the company for services. Jokic says they are currently working with 45 families. Currently, most orders are for 2,000 to 4,000 square-foot (185 to 370 square metre) units Read: Cosmic reveals updated ""high-quality"" model of all-electric micro home Jokic believes the system could also be deployed to aid in the housing crisis across the country. ""We need to end the housing crisis by allowing more people to have access to healthy and sustainable homes,"" said Jokic. Private homeowners can select from a variety of modular designs or customize a home ""We strongly believe that this is a missing piece for scaling industrialised construction across the nation to slow the housing crisis."" Cosmic plans to produce houses in the surrounding Pacific Palisades and Eaton neighbourhoods with multiple temporary sites before establishing a permanent factory. Cosmic plans to manufacture from the temporary site for several months before establishing a permanent factory in the area According to the company, the current microfactory took approximately 30 days to set-up and they plan to use the site for the next two to three months. Cosmic Buildings launched in 2022 in San Francisco with a solar-powered accessory dwelling unit . The company recently created an update to the design that features a sawtooth roof .

91,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Conductive wool replaces wiring and circuits in WoolTech electronics,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/05/wooltech-electronics-hinna-khan/,05 August 2025 – 08:00,"Wool takes the place of wiring, plastic and circuit boards in electronic devices created by designer Hinna Khan, a recent Central Saint Martins graduate inspired to find a new use for the material after watching farming documentaries. Still in early development, Khan 's WoolTech is made from a novel wool-based biomaterial, in which conductive pathways can be created using lasers. This carbonises the material so it carries electricity, while the un-carbonised sections provide natural insulation. WoolTech envisions making most of the components of electronics from wool The innovation could help to tackle the issue of e-waste, reimagining components that are usually made from a mix of metals and petrochemicals using a single organic, biodegradable material . It could also help to lower demand for mined metals, which are associated with dangerous working conditions and child exploitation. However, Khan originally came to the idea after exploring solutions to a different problem: wool waste. From watching farming documentaries – especially Clarkson's Farm, following former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson – she learnt that farmers in the UK have been shearing sheep purely for animal welfare reasons, with the wool itself having little value. The wool-based biomaterial would be carbonised to make it conductive ""The British wool industry is collapsing,"" said Khan. ""Coarse-grade fleeces now fetch as little as 60 pence per kilogram and are often discarded or burnt, costing more to shear than returns received."" ""As a result, rare British sheep breeds are being crossbred or lost in pursuit of 'higher value' wool, threatening biodiversity, heritage and local farming livelihoods."" This drove her to find new income streams for wool, with the hope to ""reimagine the entire wool industry infrastructure"". ""When I looked more closely at the fibre itself, I was amazed,"" Khan told Dezeen. ""It has incredibly high-performance technical properties that are severely underutilised and largely unknown. Yet public perception still reduces wool to something simply 'fluffy' or 'heritage'."" Conductive pathways are formed by lasers The emerging designer, who started WoolTech in her final year at London design school Central Saint Martins , brainstormed applications based on wool's technical properties, such as fire resistance and moisture-wicking. ""That's when I landed on electronics,"" said Khan. ""Wool unexpectedly ticked all the boxes, meeting technical standards and British regulations. The electronics industry is also so huge that I knew any innovation in this area with wool would really boost its value and demand."" Khan's prototypes, including a torch and a circuit board, are at this point proofs of concept based on extensive research. To develop working prototypes, she is planning to collaborate with or license the laser technology of PulpaTronics , a London-based start-up making electronics from paper. The biomaterial can be moulded into different shapes, including circuit boards She said she had originally experimented with using conductive inks made from carbonised wool, inspired by Bare Conductive , but had given up on this approach when she realised it required too much energy. PulpaTronics laser-based carbonisation process, however, ""aligned perfectly"" with WoolTech, showcasing the ""material intelligence"" of wool with its naturally high carbon content. When turning wool into a usable biomaterial, Khan focused on achieving the structural strength and water resistance necessary for electronics and experimented with over 80 different recipes, turning her kitchen into a lab. Read: Five products that use wool in new and unexpected ways She used Swaledale wool – one of the coarsest, least valued breeds, mainly used for carpets – and ultimately chose a binder derived from agricultural protein waste. There are no other additives. Khan's prototypes are completed with a water-soluble solder that she says makes for easy end-of-life disassembly, and the biomaterial printed circuit board (PCB) can be sanded and re-lasered for reuse. The material can be moulded into any form, biodegrades in three to four months, and the approach is twice as cost-effective as metal electronics, according to the designer. Designer Hinna Khan was driven by the issue of wool waste ""Coming from a non-tech background, I questioned the traditional throwaway design of electronics and PCBs – resin-coated, glued, impossible to disassemble and overly complex,"" said Khan. ""While technology often drives sustainability efforts, it rarely addresses its own environmental impact. Sustainable hardware alternatives are nearly non-existent."" ""WoolTech also champions social sustainability and justice by generating new income for hill farmers, revaluing UK heritage breeds and preserving biodiversity,"" she continued. ""This project aims to pave the way for a regenerative materials future by inspiring industries to adapt heritage materials for today's needs."" Khan is not the only designer innovating with wool.

92,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Superwood is a chemically modified wood that is stronger than steel,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/01/superwood-inventwood/,01 August 2025 – 08:00,"American start-up InventWood claims to have ""reinvented wood from the inside out"" with a patented process that restructures the material's molecules to make it ten times stronger than regular wood . InventWood developed Superwood as a more sustainable, lightweight alternative to concrete and steel in architectural applications. The company claims that the material is up to ten times stronger than regular wood and six times lighter than steel, as well as being resistant to water, insects, mould and mildew. InventWood has chemically modified wood to be stronger than steel by weight ""Superwood corrects all the flaws you have in wood, but it's still a wood,"" said InventWood CEO Alex Lau in a publicity video about the product. ""So you still get the benefits of wood but you eliminate most of the drawbacks and you take it to the level of performing like steel."" The process used to create Superwood begins with the chemical modification of regular wood, which removes most of its lignin and hemicellulose while preserving the cellulose structure. The resulting Superwood has a four-times higher density than regular wood The wood is then compressed to squeeze out all of the air and imperfections. This stage causes hydrogen bonds to form between the cellulose fibres, increasing the wood's density by up to four times. InventWood's COO Allan Bradshaw claims that the material's main benefit is a strength-to-weight ratio that is up to ten times greater than that of steel. ""What that does is it allows you to reduce volume so you can get the same strength in a smaller piece,"" said Bradshaw. ""That allows for much more open space in construction."" Read: Wood waste and bioplastic floor panel boasts the strength of steel According to InventWood, other benefits of the high-strength wood include its Class-A fire rating, which makes it suitable for construction in fire-prone areas. The material can be customised by polishing, shaping or coating it to meet specific design and application requirements. It can be installed using standard woodworking techniques and can also be painted, stained or varnished like regular wood. ""What Superwood enables is that biomaterials can become the default way to build,"" said Lau. ""Just as concrete and steel became the standard in many places, now we can say bio-based materials can be the standard – and society needs that."" The technology was developed by Liangbing Hu, whose laboratory at the University of Maryland began experimenting with the molecular manipulation of wood in 2013. It can be painted, stained or varnished like regular wood In 2018, the lab created wood that was stronger than steel but six times lighter. Hu then licensed the technology to InventWood and helped to develop it for mass production. Now, the company is preparing to begin shipments from its first commercial manufacturing facility in Frederick, Maryland. Initial shipments are due to commence in the coming months, with a focus on lower-stress contexts such as facade and cladding applications for commercial and high-end residential buildings to begin with. InventWood's principal scientist, Dr. Jack Winterowd, suggested that Superwood offers the same benefits of scalability and consistency as materials like steel. Read: Material Cultures transforms woodland waste into sustainable sheet materials ""We can think about the structural applications that would be involved with large buildings, where an ultra-strong, ultra-lightweight, eco-friendly Superwood material can replace steel and concrete,"" said Winterowd. ""This isn't just improved wood; it's wood reinvented from the inside out."" If used to replace steel in construction, the material could help to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings as it generates 90 per cent lower emissions and can act as a carbon store, the company claims. Engineered wood , such as glulam and CLT, is already being widely used in structural applications for this purpose, as explored in Dezeen's Timber Revolution series. These mass timber products aren't made by altering the wood at a chemical level. Instead, layers of timber are joined together using glue, dowels or other binders to form strong panels and beams.

93,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,MIT finds people walking faster and lingering less in public space,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/31/walking-faster-ai-study-mit-senseable-city-lab/,31 July 2025 – 09:30,"Pedestrians are walking 15 per cent faster and stopping to linger 14 per cent less than they used to, according to a study from MIT's Senseable City Lab that hopes to guide the design of public spaces . Using computer vision and artificial intelligence to analyse videos of four public spaces across three American cities, the study found that walking speeds rose notably between 1980 and 2010, while instances of people lingering or interacting with others fell. According to the researchers, the study suggests that urban designers will have to work harder than in previous decades to encourage people to slow down and have positive social experiences. MIT's Senseable City Lab used AI to analyse video footage of public spaces ""This trend suggests a growing perception of city streets as corridors for movement rather than spaces for social interaction,"" the researchers wrote in a paper published last week in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). ""These findings highlight a changing urban dynamic, where efficiency increasingly shapes public space usage, potentially impacting social connections and the community-building role of these environments."" The pattern was observed in all four sites analysed – Downtown Crossing in Boston, Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, and Bryant Park and the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York – suggesting the change is pervasive across American cities. The researchers' approach involved comparing timelapse video footage captured in these spaces by influential urbanist William H Whyte in 1980 with similar footage shot by sociologist Keith N Hampton in 2010 after he had worked on digitising Whyte's archive. Among the spaces analysed were the steps of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art The researchers used AI models to distinguish people from other objects in the videos, measure their walking speed and trajectories, and detect whether they were forming groups. The models calculated that over those 30 years, the median walking speed rose from 1.25 to 1.41 metres per second, equivalent to a 15 per cent increase, and the number of people stopping to linger – defined as reducing their speed to below 0.5 metres per second – fell from 43 per cent to 26 per cent. In 1980, one in 20 people interacted with those around them, while in 2010, it was just one in 50. Lead researcher Arianna Salazar-Miranda, who started the project at MIT's Senseable City Lab and has since moved to Yale, told Dezeen that technologies like AI and computer vision have great potential to help architects and designers understand how public spaces work. Read: MIT Senseable City Lab maps Brazilian favela with handheld 3D-scanners ""This was also the goal of William H. Whyte's groundbreaking work in the 1970s,"" she explained. ""He painstakingly annotated hours of Super 8 footage by hand."" ""He famously said: 'The crux is evaluation. Taking the film is easy... even fun. But when you start figuring out, frame by frame, what the film has to tell... the process can be enormously time-consuming... That's where it all breaks down'."" Instead of Whyte's manual approach, the researchers were able to analyse 638 hours of video footage using AI, and Salazar-Miranda suggests the technology could allow researchers to examine thousands of more hours in an instant. ""This opens up new ways to understand how people move, gather and interact in public space, and I hope it can help us design environments that better support social interaction,"" said Salazar-Miranda. Computer vision was used to determine people's walking speeds and trajectories In their paper, the researchers identify a number of potential causes for the observed changes, ranging from gentrification and rising affluence to mobile phones eliminating the need to wait for friends at a public landmark. They also speculate that the introduction of coffee shop culture to the US via Starbucks may have drawn some groups into congregating in these more ""comfortable"" private spaces instead. They conclude that thoughtful design can counter the trend for isolation and hurriedness in public space, noting that the Metropolitan Museum steps remain a place with a high rate of lingering, even if it is reduced compared to previous decades. Read: ""As architects and designers, we don't talk about toilets enough"" Salazar-Miranda and her collaborators at the MIT Senseable City Lab, Harvard and the University of Hong Kong will next take their research to Europe, with a plan to survey 40 different public squares. MIT's Senseable City Lab is headed by Carlo Ratti, who is also the curator of this year's Venice Architecture Biennale and featured this research in the exhibition. ""Public space remains more essential than ever,"" Ratti told Dezeen. ""As our lives increasingly move online, there is a real risk that public life gets confined within algorithmic comfort zones – where we scroll past discomfort and mute disagreement."" ""In an age of polarisation, public space stands as one of the last bastions of democratic coexistence.""

94,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Spktrl's AI-powered diamond ring promises to reduce screen use,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/28/spktrls-ai-ring/,28 July 2025 – 05:00,"French start-up Spktrl has developed a smart ring embedded with a 1.5-carat diamond that flashes in different colours to alert the wearer of their most pressing notifications, enabling more time spent phone-free. Spktrl was founded by Katia de Lasteyrie, a former innovation lead at luxury conglomerate LVMH, who set out to create a wearable tech object that is also a piece of high jewellery. Spktrl has created an AI-powered smart ring Driven by artificial intelligence ( AI ), the Spktrl Light Ring limits how often the wearer is interrupted by alerts from their smartphone, applying filters so only urgent messages are signalled . A system of personalised, colour-coded signals indicates the priority of incoming phone calls or messages, alerting users to key work-related contacts or messages from loved ones. A colourless lab-grown diamond is embedded in the centre Most of the time, the ring's colourless lab-grown diamond remains inactive as notifications are silenced, encouraging users to check their phone only when absolutely necessary. According to de Lasteyrie, the product offers a novel take on the concept of time being the ultimate luxury by shielding users from the constant distractions that are an inevitable consequence of living with modern technologies. The diamond lights up in different colours ""Spktrl stands for the ideal of 'quiet tech' – technology designed not to demand attention, but to refine it,"" she told Dezeen. ""It's intuitive and invisible, embedded in an object of meaning rather than distraction."" The ring connects with the user's smartphone via low-energy Bluetooth and operates through a pared-back companion app. It uses a self-learning AI model to adapt the colour, rhythm and brightness of notifications based on the wearer's habits and contextual factors such as time of day or location. It was designed to alert the wearer of their most pressing notifications Users can also personalise what messages they see and when they see them. ""Spktrl is designed for those looking to improve their digital lifestyle without relinquishing the convenience of having a smartphone or simply blocking it altogether,"" de Lasteyrie explained. ""Its gatekeeper architecture is based on the user's interaction preferences and quietly learns how to improve them over time."" Read: Seven portable AI devices that attempt to give shape to a new technology Spktrl recognises three different notification categories and associates each with a different colour – green for work, blue for family and purple for social. Users can customise the hue, saturation and brightness, but the core colours remain the same and were chosen for their instant recognisability across cultures and contexts. ""Colour perception is one of the fastest cognitive processes, interpreted by the brain even before shape or language,"" de Lasteyrie said. ""That speed is evolutionarily rooted. Colour helped early humans detect threats (blood, predators), opportunities (ripe fruit) and safe environments (greenery, water)."" The colours were chosen for their instant recognisability ""These primal associations continue to shape how we interpret colour today, making it one of the most efficient, intuitive vectors for meaning,"" she added. ""These choices aren't universal, but they're widely legible across many cultural contexts."" ""To keep the system intuitive, we also assign pulse rhythms: faster for urgent messages, slower for softer ones."" The ring itself is designed to subvert expectations of technology and the function of jewellery. Its pared-back form references the structure and sculptural balance of Art Deco architecture as well as the rawness of Brutalism. The diamond functions as a window for light and radio frequency signals De Lasteyrie explained that the decision to design a ring was informed by the object's history as a wearable symbol of identity, status and power. ""Unlike a bracelet or pendant, a ring lives on the hand, at the edge of every gesture,"" she pointed out. ""It's intimate. Your gaze returns to it constantly – it becomes part of your cognitive landscape."" ""For Spktrl, the ring is more than an adornment; it's an interface between self and society, signal and silence,"" the designer added. ""A medium for a new kind of sensorial language – a meta-language, if you will – that bypasses text or sound and speaks through light."" It will be available for pre-order in the third quarter of 2025 Set in a gold basket, the lab-grown diamond helps to diffuse the coloured light and functions as a material window for light and radio frequency signals, including Bluetooth. The Light Ring is Spktrl's debut product and will be available for pre-order in the third quarter of 2025, with products expected to be delivered in mid-2026.

95,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Meta envisions replacing keyboard and mouse with smart wristband,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/25/meta-smart-wristband/,25 July 2025 – 13:00,"Technology company Meta has said ""the wrist is the key"" to the future of human-computer interaction after its engineers created a gesture-sensing wristband prototype. Detailed in the scientific journal Nature, the wristband picks up on the tiny, barely perceptible movements of muscles at the wrist to read a variety of hand gestures, ranging from tapping the thumb against different fingertips to writing out letters. This muscle-reading technology is called surface electromyography (sEMG), and Meta believes a wrist-worn device harnessing it has the potential to overtake the keyboard, mouse and touchscreen as our primary way of interacting with computers. Meta's prototype wristband reads the subtle movements of muscles in the wrist As a control scheme it is less robotic, more intuitive and ""inherently more human"" than current offerings, the company has written in a blog post . It is also more inclusive, Meta says, as it works by reading signals that are still present after spinal cord injuries and can also be used by people with tremors who struggle with handheld devices. Meta developed the wristband prototype in its Reality Labs unit, which focuses on virtual and augmented reality and has previously developed the Orion and Ray-Ban Meta glasses. After previewing the wristband at the same time as the Orion project last year, the team has gone on to hone the prototype, getting it to the point where it can be used ""out of the box"" for simple gestures, despite differences in human physiology and behaviour. Read: Apple developing iPhones that will be controlled by users' thoughts The team has now demonstrated the technology in an article in the peer-reviewed journal Nature and in a video (shown top) that shows the sEMG interface recognising gestures including tapping, swiping and pinching. ""We believe this is the first high-bandwidth neuro-motor interface that generalises across people,"" narration on the video claims. The wristband also recognises letters as the test subject handwrites them. For greater accuracy, this feature is calibrated to the individual user. Meta imagines the wristband would work in conjunction with a headset or glasses like Orion, allowing users to carry out complex actions within an immersive digital environment. Meta predicts this could be the future of human-computer interfaces ""It's a future we've been exploring at Reality Labs for years,"" Meta said in its blog post. ""Based on our findings, we believe that surface electromyography at the wrist is the key to unlocking the next paradigm shift in human-computer interaction."" The wristband works through metal contacts on the skin that detect muscle activity and deep learning models that decode the signals and transform them into computer inputs. The gesture-based system is similar to what can be achieved using a camera or controllers with acceleration sensors, but Meta points out that these stop working if the line of sight is obscured. Read: Is this the twilight of the smartphone? There is also an obvious advantage over a neural implant, in that its not invasive, and over voice control in that it is not disruptive to others. ""It's convenient, simple and natural to use — and it works in situations where alternatives like voice interactions may be impractical or undesirable, like sending a private message out in public,"" said Meta. Meta has said it will release over 100 hours of its sEMG recordings to the scientific community in hopes of accelerating research in the field. The wearable would be used in conjunction with a headset In the Nature article, the authors also set out design rules and best practices that they recommend for hardware, data requirements and modelling. Meta rebranded from Facebook in 2021 , when it was focused on developing the metaverse. It has since pivoted to emphasise augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI). Orion and the sEMG wristband are Meta's answer to a question that has gripped Silicon Valley – whether the rise of AI is the death knell for the smartphone. Several companies are racing to come up with a device that will deliver the advanced functionality of AI but without the distraction of screens.

After previewing the wristband at the same time as the Orion project last year, the team has gone on to hone the prototype, getting it to the point where it can be used ""out of the box"" for simple gestures, despite differences in human physiology and behaviour. The team has now demonstrated the technology in an article in the peer-reviewed journal Nature and in a video (shown top) that shows the sEMG interface recognising gestures including tapping, swiping and pinching. ""We believe this is the first high-bandwidth neuro-motor interface that generalises across people,"" narration on the video claims. The wristband also recognises letters as the test subject handwrites them. For greater accuracy, this feature is calibrated to the individual user. Meta imagines the wristband would work in conjunction with a headset or glasses like Orion, allowing users to carry out complex actions within an immersive digital environment. ""It's a future we've been exploring at Reality Labs for years,"" Meta said in its blog post. ""Based on our findings, we believe that surface electromyography at the wrist is the key to unlocking the next paradigm shift in human-computer interaction."" The wristband works through metal contacts on the skin that detect muscle activity and deep learning models that decode the signals and transform them into computer inputs. The gesture-based system is similar to what can be achieved using a camera or controllers with acceleration sensors, but Meta points out that these stop working if the line of sight is obscured. There is also an obvious advantage over a neural implant, in that its not invasive, and over voice control in that it is not disruptive to others. ""It's convenient, simple and natural to use — and it works in situations where alternatives like voice interactions may be impractical or undesirable, like sending a private message out in public,"" said Meta. Meta has said it will release over 100 hours of its sEMG recordings to the scientific community in hopes of accelerating research in the field. In the Nature article, the authors also set out design rules and best practices that they recommend for hardware, data requirements and modelling. Meta rebranded from Facebook in 2021 , when it was focused on developing the metaverse. It has since pivoted to emphasise augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence (AI). Orion and the sEMG wristband are Meta's answer to a question that has gripped Silicon Valley – whether the rise of AI is the death knell for the smartphone. Several companies are racing to come up with a device that will deliver the advanced functionality of AI but without the distraction of screens.

96,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Hawaii company converts surfboard waste into construction blocks,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/23/hawaii-company-surfboard-waste-construction-blocks/,23 July 2025 – 17:00,"Surf Block Maui has developed a system that converts foam from surfboard- shaping into building materials for local construction to ameliorate multiple problems in Hawaii . Surf Block Maui was founded to address waste left behind by the surfboard industry, which uses EPS (known as styrofoam) in the production process. Surf Block Maui has created construction blocks from recycled surfboard production waste The company has created a process that takes the EPS and converts it into composite material for insulated composite concrete form (ICCF) blocks – an alternative to concrete masonry units (CMUs). When reinforced with steel, the blocks can be used to make up structural walls. These walls are then coated with poured-in-place concrete and a moisture barrier. The blocks are used as a replacement for concrete masonry units Surf Block founder David Sellers said the company aims to solve a host of problems experienced by the island, the first being a need to cut down the amount of waste from surfboard production. Other benefits include reducing the amount of concrete used in construction, most of which needs to be imported into the island, a costly expense for locals, not to mention the carbon cost of transporting materials. Surf Block says that its initiative cuts down the need for concrete by as much as 30 per cent on the island. The material alleviates the local landfill by diverting the waste ""We're on an island with limited space, limited resources, and landfills that are filling up fast,"" said Sellers. ""Creating building materials from local waste is environmentally responsible and essential. It allows us to reduce imports, cut emissions, and build in a way that's truly place-based."" Read: Walker Warner Architects includes recycled-plastic thatch in Hawaii hut resort Sellers is also the principal architect of Hawaii Off Grid Architecture and Engineering (HIOG), and has begun implementing the blocks into local homes. This initiative is especially important after the devastation caused by the 2023 wildfires on the island . Surf Block claims that the homes created with the materials also have downstream benefits, such as increased insulation and durability in case of future disasters, including earthquakes, fires and hurricanes. The blocks provide a durable and cost-efficient building material Sellers and his team are also managing the collection and production of the blocks, allowing his companies to oversee the whole process. For Sellers, the initiative resonates with the culture of Hawaii, given surfing's importance to the islands. ""Surfing was born in Hawaii, and shaping boards is still a part of daily life here,"" said Sellers. ""Being able to take that leftover foam and turn it into something strong, lasting, and community-serving carries real meaning for us."" The blocks have already been used for homes on the island Surf Block contends that even diverting five to 10 per cent of EPS waste could contribute to the construction of 100 homes on the island. Some of the homes already built are being supplemented by wood-frame upper storeys, resting on the Surf Block bases. Currently, two homes have been built on the island, with three more in permitting as rebuilds for the 2023 fire. Other projects that feature recycled plastic include a community centre in Jakarta built with 11 tonnes of plastic waste and a Hawaii resort with a thatched roof made with recycled plastic .

97,Dezeen - Technology,Architecture,IoT,Fahrenheit 180 shows tiles made from oyster shells at Lisbon's Gulbenkian art museum,https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/22/fahrenheit-180-oyster-shell-tiles-gulbenkian-art-museum/,22 July 2025 – 08:00,"Design collective Fahrenheit 180 has created tiles using discarded shells from oyster farms to show the ""potential of overlooked materials"". The tiles are currently on show in the garden of Lisbon museum Centro de Arte Moderna Gulbenkian as part of the From Tagus to the Tile exhibition – named for the Tagus river region where the oyster shells were sourced. Fahrenheit 180's tiles are made from waste oyster shells ""The project was inspired by oysters and their deep-rooted heritage in the Tagus River bioregion,"" Fahrenheit 180 co-founder Luca Carlisle told Dezeen. ""Once home to the largest natural oyster bank in Europe, the river has suffered from industrial degradation."" ""By making tiles – or azulejos – we're linking this local biomaterial with Portugal's cultural traditions, creating a material story grounded in place and memory,"" he added. They are on show at Lisbon's Gulbenkian museum The tiles were designed as part of a project called À flor do azulejo, a cor do Tejo, with the aim of prototyping materials for use in public spaces. Fahrenheit 180 sources the oyster shells from oyster farms, which would otherwise have sent them to landfills. The exhibition aims to show what can be made from ""overlooked"" materials ""We began by collecting shells from nearby seafood restaurants, though adjusting kitchen habits of separating the shells from general waste made consistent sourcing a challenge,'' Fahrenheit 180 co-founder Jeremy Morris told Dezeen. ""Eventually, we turned to oyster farms, where large quantities of discarded shells accumulate in waste piles. By reclaiming this overlooked byproduct, we diverted a small fraction from ending up in landfills."" The ground-up shells are mixed with a seaweed-based polymer The studio begins by washing and sterilising the shells using a combination of water and heat. ""Once cleaned, they're ground and sieved into different aggregate sizes, then mixed with alginate – a seaweed-based biopolymer – and water to form a moldable putty,"" Carlisle said. Read: Eight innovative materials and products made from salvaged seashells ""After air-drying and curing, the tiles can be cut, shaped and sanded,"" he added. ""We also experimented with biomaterial polishes and glazes."" The From Tagus to the Tile exhibition shows tiles in a variety of colours, from marbled blue-and-white to oranges and yellows. The designers dyed the tiles using biopigments and mineral pigments Carlisle and Morris initially dyed the material using biopigments from the region to reflect the local ecosystem, but these were UV-sensitive and would fade after a few days of sun exposure. ""As a result, we also used mineral pigments to enhance the palette while maintaining a connection to natural sources,"" Morris said. ""The long line of tiles showcases the various bio and mineral pigments we've used."" The designers worked with PhD student Mariana Simões on the pigmentation, which was created using ""different elements foraged around the banks of the Tejo, from Popiseeds to microalgaes,"" Morris said. From Tagus to the Tile ""invites a rethinking of local resources"" By showing the exhibition at the Centro de Arte Moderna Gulbenkian , the design collective hopes to help people rethink local resources as well as craft traditions, with tiles being one of Portugal's best-known traditional crafts. ""We hope people see the potential of overlooked materials like shells and seaweed, not just as waste, but as rich, living matter that can shape culture,"" Fahrenheit 180 concluded. ""The installation invites a rethinking of local resources, craft traditions, and our relationship to ecological cycles."" Oyster shells have been used for a number of materials projects featured on Dezeen, including erosion mitigation units and underwater urns . The tiles shown in From Tagus to the Tile were originally created as part of the residency Radical Waters, Concrete Matters at the Bauhaus of the Seas . The photography is by Bruno Lopes, courtesy of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. From Tagus to the Tile is on show at Gulbenkian's South Garden from 12 July 2025 to 29 July 2026.

99,Smart Buildings Alliance (SBA),Architecture,IoT,Fermeture progressive du réseau cuivre : tout comprendre pour réussir la transition vers la fibre,https://www.smartbuildingsalliance.org/fermeture-reseau-cuivre-transition-fibre-france,26 September 2025 – 14:58,"La France est engagée dans un vaste chantier de modernisation de ses infrastructures télécoms : la fermeture progressive du réseau cuivre au profit de la fibre optique. Ce projet d’envergure nationale, qui s’étendra jusqu’en 2030, touche l’ensemble des usagers : particuliers, entreprises, collectivités et opérateurs. Lors d’un webinaire organisé par la SBA, en partenariat avec le Cercle CREDO et Orange, les experts ont présenté les enjeux, le calendrier et les bonnes pratiques pour accompagner cette transition. Pourquoi fermer le réseau cuivre ? Le réseau cuivre a longtemps assuré la téléphonie et l’accès à Internet via l’ADSL. Ce basculement vers la fibre se justifie par plusieurs facteurs. Sur le plan technique, la production de composants nécessaires au réseau cuivre est progressivement arrêtée. Par ailleurs, pour maintenir le réseau jusqu’en 2030, certains nœuds de raccordement doivent être fermés afin de récupérer le matériel. Enfin, le nombre d’utilisateurs du cuivre diminue rapidement : on passe de 12,7 millions d’accès actifs fin 2023 à moins de 10 millions fin 2024, soit une baisse de plus de 20 % en seulement un an. D’un point de vue énergétique et environnemental, la fibre présente un avantage considérable puisqu’elle consomme quatre fois moins d’électricité que le cuivre. Cette migration permet à Orange de s’inscrire dans une trajectoire vers le Net Zéro Carbone en 2040, avec une réduction estimée à 160 kilotonnes de CO₂. Enfin, sur le plan économique, continuer à maintenir deux réseaux en parallèle n’est plus viable, d’autant plus que le cuivre dessert de moins en moins de foyers et coûte de plus en plus cher à entretenir. Un calendrier clair jusqu’en 2030 La fermeture du réseau cuivre se fera par maille communale et sera organisée en sept lots successifs. Chaque territoire suivra deux étapes bien définies : Fermeture commerciale : arrêt de la commercialisation de nouvelles offres sur cuivre. Fermeture technique : coupure définitive des services cuivre dans la zone. Pour garantir la bonne préparation des acteurs et des usagers, deux délais réglementaires sont fixés : 36 mois de préavis avant toute fermeture, et 12 mois minimum entre la fermeture commerciale et la fermeture technique. Le programme est déjà lancé. L’année 2025 sera un tournant majeur, marquant le passage à l’échelle du plan national. L’objectif est d’atteindre une migration complète d’ici 2030. Tous les départements français sont concernés, sauf Mayotte et l’Aveyron, avec trois départements totalement inclus dans les premiers lots : Sarthe, Mayenne et Tarn-et-Garonne. Une mobilisation collective nécessaire La réussite de ce projet repose sur une forte coordination entre plusieurs acteurs. L’opérateur du réseau cuivre, structure et coordonne le chantier industriel. Les opérateurs d’infrastructure fibre déploient le réseau dans les différentes zones et proposent aux opérateurs des offres adaptées. Ces derniers sont chargés de proposer des solutions de substitution et d’accompagner les clients dans leur migration. Les collectivités locales – régions, départements, communes et EPCI – informent leurs administrés et participent activement au déploiement et au bon déroulement du programme sur leur territoire. Les pouvoirs publics, à la fois au niveau central et déconcentré, créent les conditions de réussite et soutiennent le programme. Enfin, l’Arcep, le régulateur des télécoms, encadre la fermeture du cuivre grâce à une réglementation spécifique. Anticiper la migration : une étape clé Tout utilisateur du cuivre est concerné par cette migration, sans exception. Cela comprend la téléphonie RTC, les services Internet ADSL, SDSL, RNIS, les liaisons louées mais aussi des usages spécifiques comme la Gestion Technique du Bâtiment (GTB) ou les systèmes d’alarme. Certaines inquiétudes subsistent chez les utilisateurs, notamment quant au maintien de la qualité de service ou au risque de coupures lors de la transition. Pour éviter ces difficultés, plusieurs recommandations : La première étape consiste à vérifier la disponibilité des ressources fibre auprès de son opérateur commercial, afin de s’assurer que toutes les lignes cuivre pourront migrer sans problème. Il est également essentiel de réaliser un inventaire complet de tous les usages encore sur cuivre, surtout pour les collectivités et entreprises multi-sites. Cet inventaire, organisé site par site, permettra d’identifier précisément les services à migrer et de définir la solution adaptée pour chacun. Enfin, certains raccordements sont plus complexes et nécessitent une préparation spécifique. Une expérimentation d’aide d’État est en cours pour soutenir les particuliers et TPE dans les communes des premiers lots (1, 2 et 3). Cette aide, attribuée selon trois niveaux de difficulté, vise à faciliter la création ou la rénovation des infrastructures nécessaires à l’arrivée de la fibre dans les bâtiments. Préparer le terrain pour la fibre Le passage du cuivre à la fibre implique parfois des travaux préalables. Pour éviter tout blocage lors de la première intervention, il est recommandé de réaliser un pré-audit des infrastructures d’accueil de la fibre sur le domaine privatif. Ce diagnostic permet d’identifier les travaux éventuels à effectuer avant l’arrivée de l’opérateur, qu’il s’agisse de câblage, de matériels intermédiaires ou de locaux techniques. Il peut également orienter vers des solutions alternatives en cas de difficultés techniques, comme la 4G, la 5G ou le satellite, notamment dans les cas de raccordement différé. À noter également que d’autres transitions technologiques sont prévues dans les années à venir, notamment la fermeture progressive des réseaux 2G et 3G, qui concernent certains services de la GTB connectés via le réseau cellulaire. Des ressources pour mieux comprendre Pour accompagner les usagers, plusieurs guides et sites d’information sont disponibles. Parmi eux, on retrouve : Les guides pratiques du ministère de l’Économie, dédiés aux particuliers et aux entreprises. https://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/files/files/actu-2020/reseau_cuivre-particuliers_web.pdf https://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/files/files/actu-2020/reseau_cuivre-entreprises-web.pdf Le guide technique du Cercle CREDO, consacré à la fermeture du cuivre dans le parc immobilier existant. https://www.cercle-credo.com/guide-technique-la-fermeture-du-reseau-cuivre-dans-le-parc-immobilier-existant/ Le site d’Orange, qui détaille l’évolution de la téléphonie fixe et d’Internet ainsi que les étapes de modernisation du réseau. https://reseaux.orange.fr/nos-reseaux/modernisation-des-reseaux/evolution-de-la-telephonie-fixe-et-internet Ces documents offrent des repères fiables pour préparer la migration et répondre aux questions les plus fréquentes. Une transition à préparer dès aujourd’hui La fermeture du réseau cuivre est une étape majeure dans l’évolution des infrastructures numériques françaises. Elle permettra d’offrir à terme un réseau plus performant, plus fiable et plus respectueux de l’environnement. Pour que cette transition se passe dans les meilleures conditions, il est indispensable d’anticiper dès maintenant la migration vers la fibre ou une solution alternative, en s’appuyant sur l’accompagnement des opérateurs, des collectivités et des pouvoirs publics.

Plus qu’une technologie, elle représente une véritable révolution dans la gestion des flux hospitaliers, l’optimisation des ressources et la qualité des soins. Lors du webinaire du 16 septembre 2025, la Smart Buildings Alliance et sa commission Smart Hospital ont réuni des experts pour partager leurs expériences et leurs visions sur ce sujet. Les discussions ont mis en lumière la manière dont la géolocalisation peut contribuer à bâtir l’hôpital de demain : plus efficace, plus sûr et mieux connecté à son territoire. Pourquoi intégrer la géolocalisation dans un hôpital ? Dans le quotidien d’un hôpital, chaque seconde compte. La géolocalisation permet de savoir en temps réel où se trouvent les équipements, les patients et même les équipes soignantes. Ce suivi précis a un impact direct sur la rapidité de la prise en charge, la fluidité du parcours de soins et la sécurité de l’établissement. À court terme, les bénéfices sont concrets : le temps consacré à la recherche de matériel est considérablement réduit, les flux logistiques sont optimisés et le suivi des patients se fait de manière plus sécurisée. Par exemple, la disponibilité d’un pousse-seringue ou la localisation d’un lit prêt à accueillir un patient peuvent être consultées instantanément grâce à un système centralisé. Cette visibilité nouvelle allège la charge des équipes et améliore la qualité des soins. Sur le long terme, la géolocalisation ouvre la voie à une véritable optimisation des flux hospitaliers. L’analyse des données collectées permet d’identifier les zones de saturation et les retards récurrents, puis de réorganiser les circuits et les espaces.

Une technologie au service du soin et de l’organisation Le fonctionnement repose sur un principe simple : chaque élément à suivre – qu’il s’agisse d’un équipement, d’un patient ou d’un membre du personnel – est équipé d’un petit capteur connecté. Ces capteurs transmettent leur position à une plateforme centrale, qui restitue les informations sous forme de carte interactive ou de tableau de bord. Grâce à ce système, les décisions reposent sur des données fiables et mesurées plutôt que sur des estimations ou des impressions.

Sur le plan financier, les économies sont également notables : 80 000 € par an peuvent être économisés en évitant des achats superflus, grâce à une meilleure gestion et une utilisation optimale du matériel existant. Ces gains se traduisent non seulement par une réduction des coûts, mais aussi par une meilleure allocation des ressources humaines et matérielles.

L’analyse des données collectées permet d’identifier les zones de saturation et les retards récurrents, puis de réorganiser les circuits et les espaces. La direction dispose ainsi d’indicateurs en temps réel, tels que le nombre de patients en attente, le taux d’occupation des chambres ou la rotation des blocs opératoires, pour prendre des décisions plus efficaces et mieux anticiper les besoins. Le fonctionnement repose sur un principe simple : chaque élément à suivre – qu’il s’agisse d’un équipement, d’un patient ou d’un membre du personnel – est équipé d’un petit capteur connecté. Ces capteurs transmettent leur position à une plateforme centrale, qui restitue les informations sous forme de carte interactive ou de tableau de bord. Grâce à ce système, les décisions reposent sur des données fiables et mesurées plutôt que sur des estimations ou des impressions. Ce qui était jusqu’alors invisible devient visible, et la gestion de l’hôpital gagne en réactivité et en précision. Le webinaire, a clairement illustré le potentiel de la géolocalisation. En moyenne, chaque soignant gagne 120 heures par an grâce à la réduction du temps consacré à la recherche de matériel. Sur le plan financier, les économies sont également notables : 80 000 € par an peuvent être économisés en évitant des achats superflus, grâce à une meilleure gestion et une utilisation optimale du matériel existant. Ces gains se traduisent non seulement par une réduction des coûts, mais aussi par une meilleure allocation des ressources humaines et matérielles. En parallèle, la qualité du parcours patient s’en trouve renforcée. Moins d’attente et moins d’incertitudes favorisent une expérience plus fluide et moins anxiogène pour les patients. La géolocalisation n’est pas une simple innovation technologique. C’est un levier de transformation qui prépare l’hôpital à devenir un établissement centré sur la donnée, capable de réagir rapidement et d’anticiper les besoins futurs. En intégrant la géolocalisation à leur stratégie, les hôpitaux se dotent d’un outil puissant pour optimiser leurs ressources, améliorer la sécurité et libérer du temps médical et paramédical. La Smart Buildings Alliance considère la géolocalisation comme un pilier essentiel du Smart Hospital, un modèle d’hôpital connecté et résilient au service des patients, des soignants et des territoires.

101,Smart Buildings Alliance (SBA),Architecture,IoT,IA générative et Smart Building : révolution et enjeux pour l’écosystème du bâtiment,https://www.smartbuildingsalliance.org/ia-generative-smart-buildings-innovation-confiance,10 September 2025 – 09:29,"Le 9 septembre dernier, nous avons organisé un webinaire consacré à l’impact de l’intelligence artificielle générative (IA) sur le secteur des smart buildings. Ce rendez-vous a permis d’éclairer les fondamentaux, les cas d’usages concrets appliqués aux smart buildings, et les enjeux de confiance et de souveraineté autour de l’IA générative. IA générative : une rupture technologique majeure L’IA générative se distingue de l’IA analytique. IA analytique : exploite les données existantes pour analyser et prédire (ex. optimisation énergétique, détection de pannes). IA générative : crée du contenu nouveau (texte, images, plans, scénarios, code). Dans le secteur du bâtiment, elle ouvre la voie à la génération de plans architecturaux, la création de scénarios d’usage, ou encore la rédaction automatisée de documentation technique. C’est une véritable “cobotique des cols blancs” : des outils puissants et disponibles 24/7 qui assistent les professionnels dans leurs missions quotidiennes. Des cas d’usage concrets pour les smart buildings L’IA générative peut intervenir à toutes les étapes du cycle de vie d’un bâtiment : 1. Conception & BIM Génération de variantes architecturales, Optimisation multicritères des espaces, Vérification automatique de la conformité. 2. Exploitation & énergie Maintenance prédictive, Détection avancée d’anomalies, Scénarios d’optimisation énergétique en temps réel. 3. Services & expérience utilisateurs Assistants virtuels pour occupants, Gestion intelligente des espaces, Support technique 24/7. IA de confiance et souveraineté européenne Les enjeux stratégiques liés à l’adoption de l’IA dans le secteur ont également été mis en valeur : Dépendance aux technologies américaines et chinoises, Risque de perte de contrôle sur les données et les modèles, Besoin d’encadrement réglementaire pour éviter les dérives. L’Europe avance avec des textes structurants comme l’AI Act, le RGPD, ou la directive NIS2, afin de garantir une IA légale, éthique, robuste et durable. Une IA de confiance doit être explicable, sécurisée, respectueuse des données personnelles, et surtout alignée avec les valeurs humaines et environnementales. L’IA au service de la transition écologique L’IA générative peut contribuer à réduire l’impact environnemental des bâtiments en optimisant des consommations d’énergie (chauffage, éclairage, climatisation), en détectant et corrigeant des dérives énergétiques et enfin, en planifiant des rénovations et en gérant les ressources naturelles. Mais il ne faut pas oublier l’empreinte écologique de l’IA elle-même : l’entraînement des modèles, la consommation énergétique des data centers, et l’utilisation de matériaux rares. Et demain ? L’IA générative transforme profondément la façon dont les acteurs du bâtiment conçoivent, exploitent et gèrent leurs actifs. Pour en tirer le meilleur parti : former les équipes, définir des processus clairs et documentés, et veiller à l’éthique et la conformité des solutions déployées. “L’IA de confiance n’est pas un frein à l’innovation, mais un catalyseur d’innovation responsable.” Consulter la présentation au format PDF","A la une , Blog , Smart building | 0 commentaires Le 9 septembre dernier, nous avons organisé un webinaire consacré à l’impact de l’intelligence artificielle générative (IA) sur le secteur des smart buildings.

102,Smart Buildings Alliance (SBA),Architecture,IoT,L’intelligence artificielle : un levier incontournable pour le smart building,https://www.smartbuildingsalliance.org/ia-smart-building-optimisation-energetique,05 September 2025 – 10:16,"Le 29 avril dernier, nous avons eu le plaisir d’organiser un webinaire dédié à l’IA Analytics, qui a permis de mettre en lumière l’impact de l’intelligence artificielle dans le domaine du smart building . Cet événement a réuni plusieurs experts du secteur qui ont partagé leurs visions, retours d’expérience et perspectives sur ce sujet stratégique pour l’avenir de nos villes et bâtiments connectés. Pourquoi l’IA est incontournable pour le smart building ? L’IA s’impose aujourd’hui comme un outil essentiel pour optimiser la performance des bâtiments , réduire leur empreinte carbone et améliorer le confort des usagers. Elle permet notamment : D’analyser en temps réel la consommation énergétique, De prédire les besoins de maintenance grâce à la maintenance prédictive, D’optimiser la gestion des espaces et des flux. Les bénéfices sont nombreux, autant pour les exploitants que pour les occupants, tout en contribuant à des objectifs environnementaux ambitieux . Construire la confiance et un cadre réglementaire solide Un point clé abordé durant le webinaire fut la question de la confiance dans l’usage de l’IA . Pour que les solutions soient adoptées durablement, elles doivent être : Transparente dans leur fonctionnement, Éthique dans la collecte et l’utilisation des données, Conformes à la réglementation européenne en matière de protection des données et de déploiement des technologies d’IA. Le futur AI Act européen jouera un rôle majeur en définissant un cadre clair et sécurisé pour tous les acteurs du marché. Vers une IA générative et agentique L’évolution de l’IA ne se limite pas à l’optimisation des processus actuels. Nous entrons dans une nouvelle ère où les systèmes seront plus autonomes et proactifs , capables de prendre des décisions complexes et de s’adapter en continu. Cette IA agentique et générative ouvre la voie à des innovations encore plus disruptives pour le smart building de demain. Conclusion : l’IA, moteur de la transition énergétique et digitale Ce webinaire a confirmé que l’IA est un levier stratégique pour construire des bâtiments et des villes plus intelligents, durables et résilients. Pour réussir cette transformation, la clé réside dans la collaboration entre les acteurs technologiques, énergétiques et institutionnels , ainsi que dans la confiance accordée aux solutions d’IA.

Nous vous proposons ici un retour synthétique sur les principales informations partagées lors de cette session. Qu’est-ce que le programme LIFE ? LIFE est le seul programme européen entièrement dédié à l’environnement, à l’action climatique et à la transition énergétique. Doté d’un budget d’environ 600 millions d’euros pour l’année 2025, il soutient des projets innovants contribuant aux objectifs du Pacte vert pour l’Europe. Toute entité juridique, publique ou privée, située dans un État membre de l’UE ou un pays tiers associé, peut déposer un projet. Le programme se compose de quatre sous-programmes : Nature et biodiversité Économie circulaire et qualité de vie Atténuation et adaptation au changement climatique Transition vers une énergie propre Les appels à projets LIFE 2025 Les appels à projets pour l’année 2025 ont été publiés le 24 avril sur le portail Funding & Tenders Opportunities . Les types de projets éligibles incluent : Projets d’action standard (SAP) : ciblent un problème environnemental ou climatique spécifique. Financement moyen entre 2 et 5 millions d’euros, avec un taux de cofinancement pouvant atteindre 60 %. Projets stratégiques intégrés (SIP) et Projets stratégiques pour la nature (SNAP) : visent à mettre en œuvre à grande échelle des plans environnementaux, énergétiques ou climatiques. Ils nécessitent une note conceptuelle avant le dépôt complet. Projets préparatoires (PLP) : répondent à des priorités législatives définies par la Commission avec les États membres. Appels particulièrement pertinents pour les membres de la SBA Pour les adhérents de la SBA, certains appels du programme LIFE 2025 sont particulièrement adaptés : Thématique Climat Résilience des infrastructures et des bâtiments face aux effets du changement climatique Amélioration de l’efficacité énergétique Thématique Économie circulaire et qualité de vie Réduction globale des impacts environnementaux et sociaux des bâtiments, notamment dans le cadre du Nouveau Bauhaus européen Processus de candidature et d’évaluation Le processus d’évaluation dure environ neuf mois et repose sur quatre critères, chacun noté sur 20, pour un total de 80 points : Pertinence de la proposition Impact attendu Qualité de la mise en œuvre Ressources mobilisées Des points bonus peuvent être attribués pour des éléments comme l’innovation, la transférabilité ou la reproductibilité du projet. Accompagnement pour les porteurs de projets En France, le ministère de la Transition écologique et les Points de contact nationaux (PCN) offrent un accompagnement aux porteurs de projets. Ils assurent notamment la traduction des appels en français et organisent des ateliers d’aide à la rédaction. À noter : le rôle des PCN est informatif. Ils ne jouent pas un rôle de guichet unique ni de validation des projets.

Plusieurs membres de la SBA tenaient un stand sur place, illustrant la diversité des solutions numériques au service des établissements de santé. La SBA a organisé un parcours d’expert intitulé « Co-construisez votre Smart-Hospital avec les acteurs du numérique » , animé par Jérémy Dréan , co-président de la commission Smart Hospital. Objectif : explorer, en conditions réelles, des exemples concrets d’innovations et d’usages numériques appliqués à l’environnement hospitalier. Le parcours a débuté sur le stand ENGIE Solutions , avec une présentation du Club RéuSITH (Réflexions, Études, Usages du Système d’Information Technique Hospitalier), lieu d’échange autour des bonnes pratiques en matière de gestion technique des hôpitaux. Nous avons ensuite été accueillis par DSI Group , qui développe des solutions de géolocalisation des équipements médicaux afin de réduire les pertes de matériel et le temps consacré à leur recherche, un enjeu opérationnel majeur pour les établissements de santé. Le groupe a ensuite fait étape chez Enovacom , filiale d’Orange Business, qui développe des solutions de collecte, d’échange et d’interopérabilité des données de santé des patients, un maillon essentiel pour des parcours de soins fluides et sécurisés. Au Village des Architectes, nous avons visité le stand d’ AIA Life Designers , collectif d’architectes et d’ingénieurs œuvrant à replacer l’usager au cœur de la conception hospitalière, en mobilisant la donnée et les outils numériques au service du confort, de la performance énergétique et de l’adaptabilité des bâtiments. Le parcours s’est poursuivi chez Artelia Solutions , qui propose une offre globale ****d’accompagnement pour les établissements de santé, allant du montage financier à l’exploitation, en passant par la conception et la réalisation. Sur le stand de Kardham Digital , l’accent était mis sur l’intégration de services numériques pour optimiser l’usage des bâtiments et en faire un levier d’efficacité au service des équipes médicales comme des patients. Enfin, le tour s’est conclu sur le stand d’ Equans Digital , où les échanges ont porté sur la digitalisation des infrastructures hospitalières, l’amélioration de l’expérience des usagers et les enjeux de cybersécurité propres aux hôpitaux connectés. Cette visite s’est achevée dans un esprit de convivialité, avec un moment d’échange entre les participants. À l’issue du parcours, Christophe Clément-Cottuz et Jérémy Dréan , co-présidents de la commission Smart Hospital, se sont prêtés au jeu de l’interview avec Le Petit Biomed , un projet porté par l’ APLEB (Association des étudiants en Génie Biomédical de Polytech Lyon), autour des enjeux du Smart Hospital et des dynamiques en cours dans les établissements de santé.

Retour sur la plénière organisée par la SBA, en partenariat avec Orange Business",https://www.smartbuildingsalliance.org/5g-smart-hospital-sba-pleniere-2025,16 April 2025 – 10:05,"Smart Hospital : retour sur la plénière SBA du 7 avril 2025 Le 7 avril dernier, la Smart Buildings Alliance a organisé une plénière dédiée à l’univers du Smart Hospital , au sein du campus Orange Garden à Châtillon. Ce rendez-vous a rassemblé les membres de la Commission Smart Hospital , des experts du numérique, des industriels, des acteurs de la santé et des territoires. Un événement riche en échanges autour des innovations numériques qui transforment l’hôpital d’aujourd’hui et de demain. La 5G au cœur de l’hôpital connecté L’un des fils rouges de cette matinée fut l’essor de la 5G privée dans les établissements de santé : connectivité sécurisée, couverture indoor, continuité de service, faible latence… Les intervenants d’Orange, TDF, EQUANS ou encore Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise ont partagé cas d’usages, architectures hybrides, et réflexions sur la cohabitation des technologies (Wi-Fi / 5G) dans l’environnement hospitalier. Des cas d’usage concrets et inspirants Plusieurs démonstrations de terrain ont illustré le potentiel de la 5G dans les hôpitaux : Université Côte d’Azur (Nice) – Téléprésence 5G pour étudiants empêchés Le projet 5G Metro , co-financé par l’Union européenne, vise à lutter contre l’isolement des étudiants en situation d’hospitalisation ou de soins à domicile. Grâce à des robots de téléprésence connectés en 5G , les étudiants peuvent assister à distance aux cours, interagir en temps réel avec leurs enseignants et camarades, et se déplacer virtuellement dans les locaux du campus. Ce dispositif repose sur une infrastructure 5G Standalone déployée à l’Université Côte d’Azur , garantissant une connectivité fluide et à faible latence. L’objectif est de créer un modèle inclusif, évolutif et reproductible dans d’autres établissements. IHU Strasbourg – 5G-OR : le bloc opératoire du futur L’ IHU de Strasbourg lance le projet 5G-OR , une nouvelle génération de bloc opératoire intelligent , interconnecté via un réseau 5G privé. Ce projet réunit un consortium franco-allemand mêlant recherche, santé et industrie. Il ambitionne de transformer la pratique chirurgicale grâce à : une IA capable d’analyser les données en temps réel (imagerie, signes vitaux, protocoles), des robots chirurgicaux assistés à distance , la téléchirurgie transfrontalière , notamment entre Strasbourg, Mannheim et Berlin. La 5G permet ici une transmission ultra-fiable et instantanée des données critiques, tout en maintenant la souveraineté des infrastructures hospitalières. Orange & b<>com – Guidage patient & prévention des collisions en industrie Fruit de la collaboration entre Orange et l’institut de recherche b<>com , la solution Overview propose un système de guidage en réalité augmentée à l’intérieur des bâtiments. Grâce à une cartographie 3D précise et à la localisation des objets en temps réel via smartphone ou casque AR, il devient possible de : Guider un patient vers sa destination dans un hôpital, Prévenir les risques de collision en environnements industriels complexes (robots, véhicules, personnel), Enrichir l’expérience de navigation avec des contenus numériques. Cette technologie repose sur une connectivité 5G ou Wi-Fi pour assurer un rendu fluide, stable et sécurisé, même dans des zones vastes ou isolées. TDF – Réseau mutualisé et maîtrise de l’exposition aux ondes TDF propose une infrastructure mutualisée public/privé en 5G spécialement adaptée aux établissements hospitaliers. Au cœur de cette approche : le DAS (Distributed Antenna System) , qui permet d’assurer une couverture mobile homogène à l’intérieur des bâtiments tout en garantissant un contrôle fin de l’exposition aux ondes électromagnétiques . Les antennes déployées sont calibrées pour respecter les seuils définis par l’ANFR, et leur usage est mutualisé entre plusieurs opérateurs, ce qui réduit le besoin en équipements et optimise les coûts. Le design du DAS tient aussi compte de la cohabitation avec les autres technologies radio (Wi-Fi, DECT, etc.) . Une alliance au service de l’innovation en santé Depuis 2018, la Commission Smart Hospital portée par la SBA œuvre à construire une vision commune du Smart Hospital, avec des cadres de référence comme R2S4CARE . L’ambition : faire de l’hôpital un levier d’innovation au service des patients, des professionnels de santé, des territoires et de la souveraineté numérique. L’événement a aussi permis de souligner l’importance : de la cybersécurité des données de santé , enjeu critique pour les établissements, de la cohabitation entre technologies réseau (Wi-Fi, 5G, IoT) , et du rôle des intégrateurs et industriels pour faire émerger des projets concrets et reproductibles.

109,5G Americas - Infrastructure,Architecture,5G,"AT&T Boosts 5G Capacity Nationwide with New Spectrum, Giving Customers a Stronger, Faster Connection",https://www.5gamericas.org/att-boosts-5g-capacity-nationwide-with-new-spectrum-giving-customers-a-stronger-faster-connection/,17 November 2025 – 22:55,"AT&T Press Release Key Takeaways : AT&T has deployed mid-band spectrum 1 we agreed to acquire from EchoStar, boosting 5G download speeds by up to 80 percent, coast to coast 2 . This deployment powers improved and capital-efficient long-term growth by accelerating the Company’s ability to add converged subscribers with both 5G wireless and home internet services in more places. This spectrum integration strengthens AT&T’s best overall wireless network 3 . Both mobility and AT&T Internet Air customers will enjoy an enhanced experience. AT&T isn’t just turning on new spectrum. We’ve hit the 5G accelerator and deployed mid-band (3.45 GHz) spectrum from EchoStar to nearly 23,000 cell sites in a matter of a few weeks, which is record fast. This new spectrum makes America’s best overall network 3 even better by unlocking substantial increases in speed and capacity for customers in more than 5,300 cities across 48 states 2 . By accelerating and expanding the Company’s opportunity to offer advanced connectivity across the country, AT&T expects this transaction to support strong and sustained growth in its high-value base of converged customers that subscribe to both its home internet and 5G wireless services. In addition, AT&T expects to achieve long-term operating efficiencies as the acquisition of these licenses will reduce the need to boost network capacity through the capital-intensive construction of additional cell sites. With this spectrum now integrated into what was already the most reliable 3 and largest wireless network in North America 4 , customers are starting to see significant improvements in download speeds on upgraded spectrum bands. In fact, customers may see download speeds up to 80 percent faster for mobility and 55 percent for AT&T Internet Air. “We’ve put EchoStar spectrum to work on our network and customers are already feeling the difference,” said Jeff McElfresh, chief operating officer, AT&T . “This gives us the runway to expand availability of AT&T Internet Air for consumers and businesses and add even more download speed to our 5G service. We’re setting the bar for what it means to be the best advanced networking company in America.” As AT&T lights up new spectrum, customers can expect: More capacity for streaming, gaming, and AI-powered applications. Continued expansion of home internet options backed by the same reliable network. And continued delivery of our AT&T Guarantee , providing fast, reliable connectivity from the only provider to offer a guarantee that includes both wireless and fiber networks. This newly added spectrum strengthens our leadership in high-performance connectivity across 5G and fiber. Having the fastest and most reliable wireless network 3 — alongside our nationwide 5G standalone rollout as we move customers daily to the 5G core — underscores our commitment to innovation. Combined with progress in Open RAN , these efforts solidify our competitive standing in U.S. wireless. The spectrum expands one of the nation’s most balanced portfolios of low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, powering next-generation use cases from AI-enabled devices to enterprise edge applications. Over the past 5 years, we have invested more capital than any other company in U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. So, when it comes to how much we have invested into our network, T-Mobile and Verizon don’t compare. “We’ve been investing in our network for decades, and this deployment is another proof point of how we’re delivering the best combination of wireless and broadband connectivity in America,” said McElfresh. Deploying this spectrum also enhances first responders’ 5G experience on FirstNet®, Built with AT&T , the only network built with and for public safety. FirstNet is an all-band solution – that means first responders have always-on priority and preemption not only on public safety’s Band 14 spectrum, but across all of AT&T’s commercial spectrum bands too. It’s all part of why more first responders choose FirstNet to reliably communicate than any other network.

110,5G Americas - Infrastructure,Architecture,5G,Beyond Automation: How AI Is Giving Mobile Networks a Mind of Their Own,https://www.5gamericas.org/beyond-automation-how-ai-is-giving-mobile-networks-a-mind-of-their-own/,07 November 2025 – 19:29,"By Viet Nguyen, President, 5G Americas (Nov. 2025) When you stream a high-definition movie, join a lag-free video call, or navigate a new city with real-time maps, the experience feels effortless. Behind that simplicity lies one of the most complex systems ever created: a cellular network that manages billions of connections, radio resources, and data flows every second. For decades, engineers optimized these systems through manual tuning and static rules. That approach no longer scales. The complexity of 5G, combined with the emergence of edge computing, IoT, and AI-driven services, has made human-only management impossible. Now, networks are beginning to exhibit a new kind of intelligence—one that can learn, reason, and act with autonomy. This transformation, enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) and automation frameworks, is redefining what a communications network can be. Takeaway 1: The Network Is Learning to Understand Intent In our latest white paper “ Enabling Intent-Based Autonomous Networks ”, 5G Americas explains how the transition from manual control to intent-based operation marks a paradigm shift in how operators design and manage their networks. Rather than coding thousands of line-by-line configuration rules, operators now express what they want to achieve instead of how to achieve it. For example, instead of a long series of scripts to handle a capacity surge, an operator might simply declare an intent such as: “Guarantee premium video quality for all users in this stadium during the championship game.” The AI system interprets this intent, reallocates spectrum, deploys edge resources, and adjusts beamforming parameters across cells in real time. This approach is being tested in real-world pilots. AT&T along with Ericsson, for instance, are experimenting with intent-based slice management to dynamically allocate 5G resources for enterprise applications. Deutsche Telekom’s “ Moonshot Catalyst ” project at TM Forum demonstrated how open APIs can translate business intents into RAN and core-level configurations using the Intent Management Framework (IMF), a concept now influencing TM Forum’s AN maturity model. By decoupling “what” from “how,” AI enables networks that are self-configuring, self-optimizing, and self-healing, aligning technical behavior directly with business outcomes. North America’s early adoption of this model is already helping operators reduce latency and improve service assurance across high-demand venues and smart city environments. Takeaway 2: AI Is Both the Lock and the Key to Network Security As networks become more intelligent, the security landscape grows more complex. AI now plays both sides of the chessboard: as the defender and, increasingly, as the attacker. For instance, AT&T’s Alien Labs threat-intelligence unit uses machine-learning and analytics across the global AT&T IP network, processing over 220 petabytes of traffic and 100 billion vulnerability probes per year with continuous feedback loops to refine its threat models. In addition, 3GPP’s TS 33.891 and TM Forum’s Zero-Trust frameworks are establishing security standards that protect AI models from tampering, model poisoning, and data manipulation. Continuous validation ensures that every automated action, whether performed by a model or an agent, can be verified and traced. However, AI also gives rise to a new class of “intelligent intrusions.” Attackers can use generative models to create polymorphic malware or adaptive jamming algorithms that evade traditional detection. To counter these, operators are investing in self-healing, AI-driven defense systems that automatically isolate compromised nodes and restore service continuity. This emerging “AI arms race” demands governance as much as technology. North American operators are pioneering trust frameworks that balance autonomy with accountability, ensuring that AI becomes not just the lock but also the intelligent key to resilient, self-defending networks. Takeaway 3: Not All AI Is the Same — From Precision Tools to Creative Partners In telecommunications, AI is not a single monolithic intelligence. It is a network of specialized intelligences, each designed for a distinct purpose—some analytical, others generative. Discriminative AI functions as the precision instrument of network operations. It detects anomalies, predicts traffic surges, and optimizes resource allocation in real time. For example, Nokia’s Digital Operations Center employs discriminative AI for closed-loop fault resolution, automatically identifying and correcting RAN configuration errors without human intervention. Generative AI, by contrast, acts as a creative partner. It can synthesize new solutions and simulate network conditions to anticipate future issues. Ericsson’s Cognitive Software suite uses generative models to propose optimized parameter sets for RAN performance, while AWS Telecom Generative AI Hub enables operators to generate synthetic network data to safely train models without exposing real user information. In a typical deployment, discriminative AI may monitor live traffic to maintain stability, while generative models run simulations to predict and prevent failures—a dynamic balance between precision and foresight. Together, they form the cognitive foundation of 5G-Advanced and the bridge to 6G, where intelligent orchestration will become as important as the physical radio infrastructure itself. Takeaway 4: Your Device Is Part of the Intelligence Loop AI-driven intelligence is no longer confined to the network core. It now extends all the way to the user device, transforming smartphones, sensors, and IoT nodes into active participants in network optimization. A good example is two-sided AI/ML, where both the user equipment (UE) and the base station use coordinated AI models to enhance performance. Qualcomm and Samsung have demonstrated this approach through AI-based Channel State Feedback (CSF). Here, the UE compresses complex signal data into a small, AI-encoded representation, which the base station then decodes using its own neural network. The result: 51% throughput improvement compared to conventional Type I feedback, freeing bandwidth and reducing latency. Federated learning enables distributed devices to collaboratively train AI models by sharing model updates rather than raw data, supporting privacy-preserving analytics at scale. This approach is increasingly explored in the telecom sector for predictive maintenance and network optimization, with leading equipment manufacturers like Cisco , are investigating its potential to strengthen operational intelligence while protecting user privacy. In this paradigm, each participating device processes data locally and contributes model improvements to a shared framework, advancing network performance and reliability. This distributed AI fabric, spanning from core to edge to device, represents a fundamental rethinking of network architecture. The network no longer merely serves users; the users themselves now help teach and refine the network. Takeaway 5: The Final Challenge Is Human Trust The most advanced AI models and automation frameworks will mean little if humans don’t trust them. The journey to full autonomy is as much about governance and transparency as it is about algorithms. Operators are increasingly adopting explainable AI (XAI) and observability frameworks to make AI-driven decisions understandable. TM Forum’s Model and Agent Observability standards , introduced alongside the AN Level Validation (ANLAV) service in 2025, enable operators to independently verify the behavior of autonomous systems. In North America, AT&T’s AI Guiding Principles and T-Mobile’s Responsible AI Policy are guiding how automation is deployed safely and accountably. These programs ensure that every AI-driven action in the network is documented, explainable, and aligned with business and regulatory expectations. Trust also extends to operational readiness. Many operators still rely on legacy OSS/BSS systems that lack the data integration needed for transparent AI operations. Migration toward open, standards-aligned platforms with shared observability and governance layers will be critical to building confidence in autonomous decision-making. Ultimately, the real challenge is cultural: empowering engineers and executives alike to view AI not as a black box but as a collaborative partner whose actions are transparent, auditable, and aligned with human intent. An Invisible Infrastructure That Thinks Ahead AI is quietly transforming communications networks from reactive systems into adaptive, predictive, and autonomous infrastructures. What was once managed through static rules is now governed by intent. By integrating intent-based frameworks, trusted AI governance, and collaborative learning across devices and domains, North American operators are laying the foundation for 6G—networks that will not only respond to human commands but also anticipate them. This evolution is more than a technological leap; it’s a shift in mindset. The network is no longer a passive utility; it’s an intelligent partner. As we enter this new era, the question is no longer what can the network do, but what do we want it to understand?

112,5G Americas - Infrastructure,Architecture,5G,Redefining 5G network deployment with Ericsson Site Digital Twin,https://www.5gamericas.org/redefining-5g-network-deployment-with-ericsson-site-digital-twin/,03 November 2025 – 19:10,"Ericsson Blog Ericsson Site Digital Twin brings speed, precision, and sustainability to 5G network deployment. Solution takes advantage of efficiency and standardization, as well as sustainability and scale. Driving efficiency, compliance, and sustainability across the telecom lifecycle The telecom industry is entering a new era where networks must be deployed faster, smarter, and more sustainably. At Ericsson, we are proud to lead this transformation with the Ericsson Site Digital Twin — a solution that redefines how operators plan, design, build, and optimize their networks. By combining advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) with LiDAR, drone-based data capture, and AI-driven automation, the Ericsson Site Digital Twin creates a geospatially accurate, dynamic 3D model of every site. This model becomes the single source of truth throughout the network lifecycle — consolidating structural, electrical, and RF data into one authoritative reference. Unlike legacy workflows dependent on static documents, fragmented systems, and multiple site visits, the Ericsson Site Digital Twin provides a digital-first, collaborative foundation that reduces rework, lowers costs, and minimizes environmental impact — all while accelerating 5G rollout timelines. Scoping and planning: Clarity today, speed tomorrow The scoping and planning phase is one of the most technically demanding and resource-intensive stages of telecom deployment. Teams must assess site feasibility, RF coverage and interference patterns, free space availability, selection of the optimal RAD (Radio Access Device) center, structural integrity of towers and supporting infrastructure, power capacity, backhaul availability, grounding and lightning protection, and compliance with zoning, permitting, and safety regulations. Traditionally, this process is slowed by disaggregated data, limited site visibility, and siloed collaboration. Engineers, vendors, and project managers often rely on static PDFs, spreadsheets, and CAD files that rapidly fall out of sync, while multiple field visits are required to verify measurements, confirm tower and equipment conditions, and validate environmental and structural constraints. Civil, RF, and regulatory teams frequently operate independently, causing delays, rework, and inconsistent documentation, and text-heavy municipal submissions often fail to clearly convey complex technical requirements, slowing approvals. Ericsson Site Digital Twin overcomes these challenges by providing a geospatially precise, parametric 3D representation of each site. These models embed critical metadata including structural load limits, antenna orientation and height, free space availability, RAD center location, equipment weight, power requirements, and component compatibility — consolidating structural, electrical, and RF considerations into a single, continuously updated reference. Stakeholders can remotely assess site conditions, simulate RF coverage and interference, evaluate free space for additional equipment, test deployment scenarios, and produce detailed, visual documentation for regulatory submissions. The result is fewer site visits, reduced rework, optimized material usage, and faster compliance, enabling operators to gain clarity today and speed tomorrow while minimizing engineering and regulatory risk. Network deployment: Precision in action The deployment phase is where design plans are executed in the field, and precision is critical. Traditional workflows often face challenges such as inconsistent designs, unclear instructions, material shortages, and inefficient crew utilization, which can lead to delays, rework, and increased costs. With Ericsson Site Digital Twin, each site is represented by a standardized, parametric 3D model that serves as a single source of truth for all stakeholders. These models ensure that every deployment follows consistent templates while embedding key metadata — including RAD center locations, free space, structural load limits, equipment weight, and power requirements. This integrated approach enables: Standardized designs : Templates and design parameters can be applied consistently across multiple sites, regardless of geography or vendor. Clarity for crews : Construction teams receive precise, unambiguous instructions, reducing errors and misinterpretations. Skilled labor efficiency : With workforce shortages a growing challenge, Ericsson Site Digital Twin workflows maximize productivity by minimizing wasted time. Automated BoM creation : Site models automatically generate accurate Bills of Materials (BoM) aligned with design specifications, ensuring the right parts are ordered in the right quantities the first time. Material readiness : Integration with inventory and forecasting systems ensures the correct equipment is available on site, reducing delays and idle crew time. Operational oversight : Real-time monitoring of work orders, site verifications, acceptance checks, and OHS compliance keeps the project on track and maintains quality standards. By combining the engineering accuracy of BIM with the dynamic capabilities of the Ericsson Site Digital Twin, operators achieve faster builds, fewer outages, optimized resource utilization, and deployment schedules that remain on track — all while maintaining safety, quality, and regulatory compliance. Post-build optimization: Living networks, continuous improvement Even after construction, networks require validation, documentation, and fine-tuning to ensure long-term performance. Traditional approaches are manual and fragmented, often leading to: Delayed detection of construction or integration issues. Inconsistent records of redlines and as-built conditions. Longer tuning cycles with limited pre-analysis capabilities. Higher compliance risks from incomplete documentation. Ericsson Site Digital Twin streamlines this phase by serving as a continuously updated “as-built” record. With fresh LiDAR scans, drone imagery, and engineering inputs, operators can: Automatically compare as-built conditions against original designs. Seamlessly capture and integrate redline updates. Run remote simulations to prepare tuning strategies before on-site adjustments. Maintain centralized documentation, making audits faster and less disruptive. This reduces unnecessary site visits, accelerates quality assurance, and ensures ongoing compliance—keeping networks optimized, reliable, and sustainable. Environmental and economic impact Ericsson Site Digital Twin not only enhances operational efficiency but also aligns with global sustainability goals. By reducing the need for multiple site visits, optimizing material usage, and minimizing rework, the solution significantly lowers the carbon footprint of network deployments. Economically, the solution delivers additional savings through automated BOM creation, which eliminates over-ordering, avoids shortages, and improves capital expenditure accuracy. Operators also reduce labor costs by minimizing field visits and maximizing crew efficiency. Standardized designs and real-time inventory integration prevent errors, while faster deployment timelines and streamlined regulatory approvals reduce project costs — enabling operators to bring 5G services to market more quickly and competitively. Scalability and adaptability for future networks As telecom networks evolve toward 6G and beyond, the complexity of deployments will only increase. Ericsson Site Digital Twin is inherently scalable, capable of integrating new data sources such as IoT sensors, AI-driven analytics, and real-time network performance metrics. This adaptability ensures that the solution remains relevant for future technologies, supporting operators in managing increasingly dense and heterogeneous networks. Moreover, Ericsson Site Digital Twin facilitates collaboration across global teams and vendors. Cloud-based platforms allow stakeholders to access and update models in real time, ensuring alignment across geographies and reducing the risk of miscommunication. This collaborative framework is particularly valuable for multinational operators managing large-scale deployments across diverse regulatory environments. Looking ahead: The future of network deployment Ericsson Site Digital Twin is ushering in a new era where telecom deployments are driven by data, collaboration, and environmental awareness. By continuously updating the model with the latest site data, operators maintain an accurate reference that supports maintenance and future upgrades. Those who embrace this digital-first approach gain a real advantage. They can roll out networks faster, lower costs, meet compliance standards more easily and reduce environmental impact. It’s a smarter, more responsible way to build the resilient networks that tomorrow’s world demands.

116,5G Americas - Infrastructure,Architecture,5G,Pushing Forward on Open RAN,https://www.5gamericas.org/pushing-forward-on-open-ran/,24 October 2025 – 17:47,"AT&T Press Release t’s no secret we’ve made impressive strides on our Open RAN journey to transition from closed, proprietary network architectures to fully open and programmable networks – a move designed to unlock speed, flexibility, and greater choice. In August, we announced the successful completion of the first Open RAN call using third-party radios at the AT&T Labs in collaboration with Ericsson and 1Finity. And now? We’ve quickly achieved another major milestone with these companies by completing the first Open RAN call using third-party radios over AT&T’s commercial network. This multivendor solution demonstrates the interoperability and flexibility Open RAN brings to our network, underscoring the critical role of collaboration in developing open and programmable networks that can transform the industry. “Open RAN is more than a technology shift – it’s a catalyst for innovation and collaboration across the industry. By proving multivendor interoperability on AT&T’s commercial network, we’re not just advancing technology – we’re shaping an ecosystem that will accelerate innovation for our customers and the entire industry,” said Patrik Eriksson, vice president and head of the Mobile System Business Unit at 1Finity . “This is a significant milestone for the industrialization of Open RAN, with the 1Finity radio operating with fully commercialized Ericsson software in the AT&T Network. The 1Finity radios are integrated into Ericsson’s Intelligent Automation Platform, its Open RAN management and automation platform, which enables multi-vendor radio support. It is a great proof point for Open RAN ecosystem collaboration,” said Paul Challoner, vice president and chief technology officer, Customer Unit AT&T, Ericsson . Since announcing our plan to modernize our wireless network, we’ve made significant progress. To date, we’ve already completed nearly 40% of our overall swap program from Nokia radios to Ericsson. Additionally, we’ve added valuable mid-band (N77) spectrum to over 15,000 sites which deliver increased speeds and a greatly improved wireless experience for our customers. This accomplishment is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our teams. And this achievement isn’t just a technical milestone – it’s a clear signal that the future of wireless will be open, agile, and innovation-driven.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) This Press Release includes non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information provided in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided below. T-Mobile is not able to forecast Net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income, including, but not limited to, Income tax expense and Interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict Net income as the difference between either of these measures and Net income is variable. Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to Net income as follows: (1) Stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, certain stock-based compensation expenses associated with the Sprint merger have been included in Merger-related costs (gain), net. (2) Merger-related costs (gain), net includes Sprint merger-related costs and UScellular merger-related costs. (3) Merger-related costs (gain), net, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, includes the $100 million gain recognized for the extension fee previously paid by DISH associated with the DISH License Purchase Agreement. (4) Legal-related expenses (recoveries), net consists of the settlement of certain litigation and compliance costs associated with the August 2021 cyberattack, net of insurance recoveries. (5) Other, net, primarily consists of certain severance, restructuring and other expenses, gains and losses, not directly attributable to the Sprint merger or UScellular acquisition, which are not reflective of T-Mobile’s core business activities and are, therefore, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before Interest expense, net of Interest income, Income tax expense, Depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain expenses, gains and losses, which are not reflective of our ongoing operating performance (“Special Items”). Special Items include Merger-related costs (gain), net, certain legal-related expenses and recoveries, Impairment expense, restructuring costs not directly attributable to the Sprint merger or UScellular acquisition (including severance), and other non-core gains and losses. Core Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA less device lease revenues. Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by T-Mobile’s management, including our chief operating decision maker, to monitor the financial performance of our operations and allocate resources of the Company as a whole. T-Mobile uses Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as benchmarks to evaluate T-Mobile’s operating performance in comparison to its competitors. T-Mobile also uses Core Adjusted EBITDA internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate its personnel and management for their performance. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of T-Mobile’s ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of Interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, and Special Items. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the company’s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the related depreciation expense on leased devices, which is excluded from the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Core Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for Net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). T-Mobile US, Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures (continued) (Unaudited) Adjusted Free Cash Flow is calculated as follows: Effective November 1, 2024, following amendments to the company’s Equipment Installment Plan Sale and Service Receivable Sale arrangements, all cash proceeds associated with the sale of such receivables, a portion of which was previously recognized as Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions within investing cash flows, were recognized as operating cash flows. These amendments did not have a net impact on Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted Free Cash Flow – Net cash provided by operating activities less Cash purchases of property and equipment, plus Proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is utilized by T-Mobile’s management, investors and analysts to evaluate cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares, pay dividends and provide further investment in the business. Adjusted Free Cash Flow margin – Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Service revenues. Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin is utilized by T-Mobile’s management, investors, and analysts to evaluate the company’s ability to convert service revenue efficiently into cash available to pay debt, repurchase shares and provide further investment in the business. The current guidance range for Adjusted Free Cash Flow is calculated as follows: The previous guidance range for Adjusted Free Cash Flow was calculated as follows: T-Mobile US, Inc. Operating Measures (Unaudited) The following table sets forth company operating measures ARPA and ARPU: Postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (“ARPA”) – Average monthly postpaid service revenue earned per account. Postpaid service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of postpaid accounts during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) – Average monthly service revenue earned per customer. Service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues.
