In this paper, we present a 3D mask-based metallization process that achieves ultra-thin 7 nm metallization on resonators through precise thickness distribution control. This method comprehensively analyzes the film thickness distribution and the energy distribution of the resonator, and reduces the film damping by regulating the film thickness distribution on the inner surface of the resonator through a mask. Our results show that this method reduces the film thickness from 13 nm to 7 nm (46.5% reduction) while maintaining the electrical conductivity and improving the Q-factor by 8.4 percentage points.

Experimental validation confirms that the 7 nm Pt film not only meets the low resistance ( $\le 500~\Omega $ ) requirement, but also reduces the energy dissipation of the resonator by minimizing thermoelastic damping and internal friction.

A three-level serial kinematic scheme within a monolithic wafer, i.e., a three-level frame-in-frame structural configuration, is employed to mitigate motion crosstalk across the X-, Y-, and Z-axes. In the in-plane comb-drive XY-microstage, which comprises four actuation units, both decoupling-motion structural design and capacitance-coupling crosstalk constraints are implemented to ensure low-crosstalk movements along the ±X- and ±Y-axes. Four sets of out-of-plane Al/SiO2 bimorph actuators independently actuate the comb-drive XY-microstage along the Z-axis. Additionally, mechanical Si-springs are introduced to facilitate electrical interconnections between the XY-microstage and external pads. This design also overcomes the limitation of out-of-plane stroke space in a monolithic wafer, thereby maximizing the actuation potential to achieve significant out-of-plane displacement.

In instances where manufacturing errors are present, both mass perturbations and stiffness perturbations are introduced concurrently, leading to frequency split. Given that the formation errors of micro hemispherical resonator, specifically mass and stiffness disturbances, are predominantly concentrated in the shell, this paper proposes a micro hemispherical resonator with adjustable rim width, whose rim area is distributed circumferentially around the shell periphery. An equivalent geometric model of the resonator was established, and finite element simulation was used to study the influence of rim width on the frequency split of the resonator under different harmonic errors. It was determined that within a specified error range, adjusting the rim width results in a minimum value for the frequency split. To validate the effectiveness of the simulation results, the rim width was altered using femtosecond laser direct etching, and the resonant frequencies were measured at different rim widths. The experimental findings demonstrated that the frequency split of the resonator attained a minimum at a rim width of 0.7 mm, with a frequency split of only 1.09 Hz (86.44 ppm), which was 8.4 times lower than that at a rim width of 0 mm.

This platform represents a significant step toward precise, programmable drug delivery in anatomically constrained or delicate regions.[2025-0104]",,5,5,Valentin,2025-11-18T14:51:46.846176

The system is designed to target an image of  $1280\times 720$  pixels. Two separate mirrors are used to steer a single, modulated, laser source across the screen: one, operated at its resonance frequency, performs a sinusoidal horizontal scan, while the second, operated in the quasi-static regime, performs the vertical scan. The maximum frame rate at the target resolution is 60 Hz when bidirectional scanning is exploited. The amplitude and frequency errors of the horizontal scan are 18.5 mdeg and 52 ppm, respectively, while the linearity of the vertical scan is 3.4 mdeg, i.e., 580 ppm of the field-of-view, with a mean frame-to-frame reproducibility of 5.5 mdeg.

Ladder and lattice types are two basic filter topologies used in unbalanced and balanced systems, respectively. Compared to ladder filters, lattice filters have advantages of larger bandwidth and better trade-off between out-of-band rejection and roll-off. However, the current lattice filters are restricted by their incompatible balanced terminals with other radio frequency devices. In this work, a hybrid integration of integrated passive device (IPD) and lattice-type bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filter with unbalanced terminals was proposed. The IPD network achieved phase flip and transformed the balanced terminal into unbalanced terminal of the lattice-type BAW filter. To realize a more compact integration of the BAW device and phase-flip network, for the first time we achieved Si microcap capacitor structure, which can also be adopted for 3D integration of other acoustic and electromagnetic devices. The fabricated filter achieved a minimum insertion loss of 1.39 dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 145 MHz, a relative bandwidth fraction of 7.2%. Compared with the ladder type filter with same resonator number, the phase-flip lattice filter achieved ~30% improvement in bandwidth. This work brings new methodology for the topology designs of lattice filters and compact integration of capacitors and inductors with BAW devices.

For this issue, accelerated degradation testing (ADT) is widely used as an efficient strategy to obtain the long-term reliability of MEMS devices in a short amount of time. Therefore, precise and robust monitoring of performance degradation in harsh environments is the foundation of ADTs. However, current electro-mechanical-coupling methods, especially on-chip piezoresistive sensors, exhibit sensitivity shifts and must be calibrated manually at different temperatures, making them costly and restricting the accuracy. Here, we propose a calibration-free, temperature-robust split accelerated degradation testing platform (S-ADTP), which can accurately evaluate the long-term reliability of 2D MEMS micromirrors without any thermal-induced sensitivity shifts. S-ADTP eliminates the error of the FOV detection caused by sensitivity shifts, contributing to higher and more temperature-robust accuracy than electro-mechanical-coupling methods. ADTs with single and multiple stresses are subsequently conducted. Experimental results reveal the distinct failure mechanisms associated with varying environmental conditions, indicating that the crack propagation is the primary failure mode in high-temperature environments, while the demagnetization of permanent magnets becomes dominant in temperature-humidity coupling environments. The work can provide a calibration-free and temperature-robust method without any thermal-induced sensitivity shifts in ADTs for 2D micromirrors, and distinguish the complicated multi-failure mechanisms triggered by distinctive environmental stresses.[2025-0062]",,5,5,Valentin,2025-11-18T14:51:46.846286

Among various nonlinear phenomena, internal resonance referring to energy exchange between different vibration modes in a resonant cavity has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated with a great potential for improving the sensitivity performance compared to conventional frequency modulated resonant sensors. In particular, mechanical frequency combs induced by unstable internal resonance in which time-varying energy transfer between modes occurs, have emerged as alternative candidates for boosting the sensitivity. This work experimentally shows this by 1:6 internal resonance derived frequency comb spacing modulation in micromechanical resonators, revealing more than  $30\times $  enhancement in response to temperature change compared to that in a regular resonator counterpart. Based on the nonlinear model developed in this work, the use of 1:6 internal resonance is key to attaining linear dependence of comb spacing against temperature variation. The results show a new paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing schemes. [2025-0036]",,5,5,Valentin,2025-11-18T14:51:46.846340

The approach employs biocompatible, low-cost materials—including medical-grade tapes, rubber, and thermoplastics (PMMA, polycarbonate, polystyrene)—micromachined via femtosecond lasers. Solvent- and heat-free tape-based bonding enables efficient fabrication of optically transparent, UV-sterilizable layers for biomedical applications. The method supports integrated on-chip pumps and active/passive valves, achieving bidirectional and multidirectional flow control with minimal external actuation. These components operate at up to 14 psi actuation pressure and  $230~\mu $ L/min flow rates, adaptable via chamber dimensions. A dual-pump configuration mimics peristaltic pumping for continuous flow, while a prototype with multidirectional pumps and reservoirs demonstrates dynamic fluid routing and on-demand distribution. The technique offers a versatile, scalable solution for microfluidic applications requiring sterility, optical clarity, and on-chip fluidic control.

To enable the polymer cantilever deflection, a light-heat converting film consisted of carbon nanotubes (CNT) or nitrocellulose lacquer was applied to the surface of the cantilever. This film causes IR absorption and its efficient conversion into heat that induces local change in the phase of the structural material and, therefore, the cantilever deflection and hence actuation. To our knowledge, this solution has not been previously presented in the literature. The research was conducted on the cantilevers printed using the inkjet technique. The results demonstrated a direct correlation between the laser power supply current and the deflection of the cantilevers tip; with adjusting the current, the beam tip achieved a significant deflection ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers. Additionally, for 100 cycles, where in one cycle the laser beam was ON-OFF, the cantilever retained its mechanical properties; meanwhile, the film endured. These findings open new possibilities for the practical application of this remote actuation method across various fields of engineering, in micro- and microscale, and beyond, such as 4D printing structuring components and further for advanced actuators and sensors.
